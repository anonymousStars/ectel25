        "A": "  \nA: The significance of \"infinite descent\" in number theory lies in its utility for establishing the non-existence of solutions to certain Diophantine equations by demonstrating that any proposed solution leads to a smaller solution, thus creating an infinite regression that contradicts the notion of a smallest natural number."

The most recent version of the book is freely available for download from the following website:\n\n[https://infinitedescent.xyz](https://infinitedescent.xyz)\n\nThe website also includes information about changes between different versions of the book, an archive of previous versions, and some resources for using LaTeX (see also Appendix D).\n\n## About the book\n\nA student in a typical calculus class will learn the chain rule and then use it to solve some prescribed ‘chain rule problems’ such as computing the derivative of \\(\\sin(1 + x^2)\\) with respect to \\(x\\), or perhaps solving a word problem involving related rates of change. The expectation is that the student correctly apply the chain rule to derive the correct answer, and show enough work to be believed. In this sense, the student is a *consumer* of mathematics. They are given the chain rule as a tool to be accepted without question, and then use the tool to solve a narrow range of problems.\n\nThe goal of this book is to help the reader make the transition from being a *consumer* of mathematics to a *producer* of it. This is what is meant by ‘pure’ mathematics. While a consumer of mathematics might learn the chain rule and use it to compute a derivative, a producer of mathematics might derive the chain rule from the rigorous definition of a derivative, and then prove more abstract versions of the chain rule in more general contexts (such as multivariate analysis).\n\nConsumers of mathematics are expected to say how they used their tools to find their answers. Producers of mathematics, on the other hand, have to do much more: they must be able to keep track of definitions and hypotheses, piece together facts in new\n</markdown>",
        "Q": "Q: How can one derive the chain rule for derivatives from the rigorous definition of a derivative? ",
        "A": " A: To derive the chain rule, start with the definition of the derivative: if \\( f(x) = g(h(x)) \\), then the derivative \\( f'(x) \\) is given by \\( f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{g(h(x + h)) - g(h(x))}{h} \\). By applying the definition of the derivative to \\( g \\) at \\( h(x) \\) and using the limit definition for \\( h(x) \\), you arrive at \\( f'(x) = g'(h(x)) \\cdot h'(x) \\), which is the chain rule."

In Appendix A, we also have proof extracts. To improve navigability, these categories are distinguished by name, colour and symbol, as indicated in the following table.\n\n| Category    | Symbol | Colour  | Category      | Symbol | Colour |\n|-------------|--------|---------|---------------|--------|--------|\n| Definitions | ◆      | Red     | Examples      | 🖉     | Teal   |\n| Results     | ✶      | Blue    | Exercises     | ✎      | Gold   |\n| Remarks     | ❖      | Purple  | Proof extracts| 〃     | Teal   |\n\nThese items are enumerated according to their section—for example, Theorem 9.2.41 is in Section 9.2. Definitions and theorems (important results) appear in a box.\n\nYou will also encounter the symbols □ and ◁ whose meanings are as follows:\n\n- **□ End of proof.** It is standard in mathematical documents to identify when a proof has ended by drawing a small square or by writing ‘Q.E.D.’ (The latter stands for *quod erat demonstrandum*, which is Latin for *which was to be shown*.)\n\n- **◁ End of item.** This is *not* a standard usage, and is included only to help you to identify when an item has finished and the main content of the book continues.\n\nSome subsections are labelled with the symbol ★. This indicates that the material in that subsection can be skipped without dire consequences.\n\n## Licence\n\nThis book is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 (CC BY-SA 4.0) licence.

His course heavily influenced my approach to teaching, and it motivated me to write this book in the first place. Many of the pedagogical decisions I made when writing this book were informed by research that I was exposed to as a student in Chad’s class.\n\nThe legendary Carnegie Mellon professor, John Mackey, has been using this book (in various forms) as course notes for 21-128 *Mathematical Concepts and Proofs* and 15-151 *Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science* since Fall 2016. His influence can be felt throughout the book: thanks to discussions with John, many proofs have been reworded, sections restructured, and explanations improved. As a result, there is some overlap between the exercises in this book and the questions on his problem sheets. I am extremely grateful for his ongoing support.\n\nSteve Awodey, who was my doctoral thesis advisor, has for a long time been a source of inspiration for me. Many of the choices I made when choosing how to present the material in this book are grounded in my desire to do mathematics *the right way*—it was this desire that led me to study category theory, and ultimately to become Steve’s PhD student. I learnt a great deal from him and I greatly appreciated his patience and flexibility in helping direct my research despite my busy teaching schedule and extracurricular interests (such as writing this book).\n\nPerhaps unbeknownst to them, many insightful conversations with the following people have helped shape the material in this book in one way or another: Jeremy Avigad, Deb Brandon, Santiago Cañez, Heather Dwyer, Thomas Forster, Will Gunther, Kate Hamilton, Jessica Harrell, Bob Harper, Brian Kell, Marsha Lovett, Ben Millwood,\n</markdown>",

First, I have been an active member of Mathematics Stack Exchange (https://math.stackexchange.com/) since early 2012 and have learnt a great deal about how to effectively explain mathematical concepts; occasionally, a question on Mathematics Stack Exchange inspires me to add a new example or exercise to the book.

This support is now continued by the Department of Mathematics at Northwestern University, where I am currently employed as a lecturer.\n\nI would also like to thank everyone at Carnegie Mellon’s and Northwestern’s teaching centres, the Eberly Center and the Searle Center, respectively. Through various workshops, programs and fellowships at both teaching centres, I have learnt an incredible amount about how people learn, and I have transformed as a teacher. Their student-centred, evidence-based approach to the science of teaching and learning underlies everything I do as a teacher, including writing this book—their influence cannot be understated.\n\nFinally, and importantly, I am grateful to the 1000+ students who have already used this book to learn mathematics. Every time a student contacts me to ask a question or point out an error, the book gets better; this is reflected in the dozens of typographical errors that have been fixed as a consequence.\n\nClive Newstead  \nJanuary 2020  \nEvanston, Illinois\n</markdown>",

Consider the following statement:\n\n*This sentence is false.*\n\nIs it true or false? If you think about this for a couple of seconds then you’ll get into a bit of a pickle.\n\nNow consider the following statement:\n\n*The happiest donkey in the world.*\n\nIs it true or false? Well it’s not even a sentence; it doesn’t make sense to even *ask* if it’s true or false!\n\nClearly we’ll be wasting our time trying to write proofs of statements like the two listed above—we need to narrow our scope to statements that we might actually have a chance of proving (or perhaps refuting)! This motivates the following (informal) definition.\n\n✦ **Definition 0.1**  \nA *proposition* is a statement to which it is possible to assign a *truth value* (‘true’ or ‘false’). If a proposition is true, a *proof* of the proposition is a logically valid argument demonstrating that it is true, which is pitched at such a level that a member of the intended audience can verify its correctness.\n\nThus the statements given above are not propositions because there is no possible way of assigning them a truth value. Note that, in **Definition 0.1**, all that matters is that it\n</markdown>",

For example, if you just want to skim a paper and find its key results, you’d look for results labelled as *theorems*.\n\nIt is not much good trying to prove results if we don’t have anything to prove results about. With this in mind, we will now introduce the *number sets* and prove some results about them in the context of four topics, namely: division of integers, number bases, rational and irrational numbers, and polynomials. These topics will provide context for the material in Part I, and serve as an introduction to the topics covered in Part II.\n\nWe will not go into very much depth in this chapter. Rather, think of this as a warm-up exercise—a quick, light introduction, with more proofs to be provided in the rest of the book.\n\n### Number sets\n\nLater in this chapter, and then in much more detail in Chapter 2, we will encounter the notion of a *set*; a set can be thought of as being a collection of objects. This seemingly simple notion is fundamental to mathematics, and is so involved that we will not treat sets formally in this book. For now, the following definition will suffice.\n</markdown>",

At this introductory level, many details will be temporarily swept under the rug; we will work at a level of precision which is appropriate for our current stage, but still allows us to develop a reasonable amount of intuition.\n\nIn order to define the number sets, we will need three things: an infinite line, a fixed point on this line, and a fixed unit of length.\n\nSo here we go. Here is an infinite line:\n\nThe arrows indicate that it is supposed to extend in both directions without end. The points on the line will represent numbers (specifically, **real numbers**, a misleading term that will be defined in Definition 0.25). Now let’s fix a point on this line, and label it ‘0’:\n\nThis point can be thought of as representing the number zero; it is the point against which all other numbers will be measured.

Tally marks provide one method of counting small numbers: starting with nothing, proceed through the objects you want to count one by one, and make a mark for every object. When you are finished, there will be as many marks as there are objects. We are taught from a young age to count with our fingers; this is another instance of making tally marks, where now instead of making a mark we raise a finger.\n\nMaking a tally mark represents an **increment** in quantity—that is, adding one. On our number line, we can represent an increment in quantity by moving to the right by the unit length. Then the distance from zero we have moved, which is equal to the number of times we moved right by the unit length, is therefore equal to the number of objects being counted.\n\n### Definition 0.5\n\nThe **natural numbers** are represented by the points on the number line which can be obtained by starting at 0 and moving right by the unit length any number of times:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccccc}\n0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nIn more familiar terms, they are the **non-negative whole numbers**.

        "content": "<markdown>\nThe natural numbers have very important and interesting mathematical structure, and are central to the material in Chapter 8. A more precise characterisation of the natural numbers will be provided in Section 4.1, and a mathematical construction of the set of natural numbers can be found in Section B.1 (see Construction B.2.5). Central to these more precise characterisations will be the notions of ‘zero’ and of ‘adding one’—just like making tally marks.\n\n❖ **Aside**\n\nSome authors define the natural numbers to be the positive whole numbers, thus excluding zero. We take 0 to be a natural number since our main use of the natural numbers will be for counting finite sets, and a set with nothing in it is certainly finite! That said, as with any mathematical definition, the choice about whether \\(0 \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) or \\(0 \\notin \\mathbb{N}\\) is a matter of taste or convenience, and is merely a convention—it is not something that can be proved or refuted.\n\n## Number bases\n\nWriting numbers down is something that may seem easy to you now, but it likely took you several years as a child to truly understand what was going on. Historically, there have been many different systems for representing numbers symbolically, called *numeral systems*. First came the most primitive of all, tally marks, appearing in the Stone Age and still being used for some purposes today. Thousands of years and hundreds of numeral systems later, there is one dominant numeral system, understood throughout the world: the *Hindu–Arabic numeral system*. This numeral system consists of ten symbols, called *digits*. It is a *positional numeral system*, meaning that the position of a symbol in a string determines its numerical value.\n\nIn English, the *Arabic numerals* are used as the ten digits:\n\n\\[\n0 \\quad 1 \\quad 2 \\quad 3 \\quad 4 \\quad 5 \\quad 6 \\quad 7 \\quad 8 \\quad 9\n\\]\n\nThe right-most digit in a string is in the units place, and the value of each digit increases by a factor of ten moving to the left. For example, when we write ‘2812’, the left-most ‘2’ represents the number two thousand, whereas the last ‘2’ represents the number two.\n\nThe fact that there are ten digits, and that the numeral system is based on powers of ten, is a biological accident corresponding with the fact that most humans have ten fingers. For many purposes, this is inconvenient. For example, ten does not have many positive divisors (only four)—this has implications for the ease of performing arithmetic; a system based on the number twelve, which has six positive divisors, might be more convenient. Another example is in computing and digital electronics, where it is more convenient to work in a *binary* system, with just two digits, which represent ‘off’ and ‘on’ (or ‘low voltage’ and ‘high voltage’), respectively; arithmetic can then be performed directly using sequences of *logic gates* in an electrical circuit.\n</markdown>",
        "Q": "Q: What are the advantages of using a base twelve numeral system compared to the base ten system in terms of divisibility? ",
        "A": " A: A base twelve numeral system has more positive divisors (six: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12) compared to the base ten system, which has only four positive divisors (1, 2, 5, and 10). This greater number of divisors makes it more convenient for performing arithmetic operations and dividing quantities into equal parts."

They include theorems that have already been proved, prior knowledge which is assumed of the reader, and assumptions which are explicitly made using words like ‘suppose’ or ‘assume’.\n\n- **Goals** are the propositions we are trying to prove in order to complete the proof of a result, or perhaps just a step in the proof.\n\nWith every phrase we write, our assumptions and goals change. This is perhaps best illustrated by example.

But importantly, it suggests that the same proof strategy might work for other propositions which are also of the form ‘if \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\), then \\(R\\)’, such as the following proposition (for a given integer \\(n\\)):\n\n\\[ \n\\text{If } n > 2 \\text{ and } n \\text{ is prime, then } n \\text{ is odd.}\n\\]\n\nObserve that the simpler propositions are joined together to form a more complex proposition using language, namely the word ‘and’ and the construction ‘if... then...’—we will represent these constructions symbolically using *logical operators*, which will be introduced in Definition 1.1.3.\n\nZooming in even more closely, we can use Definition 0.12 to observe that ‘\\(c\\) divides \\(b\\)’ really means ‘\\(b = qc\\) for some \\(q \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\)’. The expression ‘for some \\(q \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\)’ introduces a new variable \\(q\\), which we must deal with appropriately in our proof.

Propositional variables may be assigned **truth values** (‘true’ or ‘false’).\n\nWe will typically use the lower-case letters \\( p, q, r \\) and \\( s \\) as our propositional variables.\n\nWe will be able to form more complex expressions representing propositions by connecting together simpler ones using **logical operators** such as \\(\\land\\) (which represents ‘and’), \\(\\lor\\) (which represents ‘or’), \\(\\Rightarrow\\) (which represents ‘if…then…’) and \\(\\lnot\\) (which represents ‘not’).\n\nThe definition of the notions of **logical operator** and **propositional formula** given below is a little bit difficult to digest, so it is best understood by considering examples of propositional formulae and instances of logical operators. Fortunately we will see plenty of these, since they are the central objects of study for the rest of this section.\n\n✦ **Definition 1.1.3**  \nA **propositional formula** is an expression that is either a propositional variable, or is built up from simpler propositional formulae (‘subformulae’) using a **logical operator**. In the latter case, the truth value of the propositional formula is determined by the truth values of the subformulae according to the rules of the logical operator.\n\nOn first sight, **Definition 1.1.3** seems circular—it defines the term ‘propositional formula’ in terms of propositional formulae! But in fact it is not circular; it is an example of a **recursive** definition (we avoid circularity with the word ‘simpler’). To illustrate, consider the following example of a propositional formula:\n\n\\[\n(p \\land q) \\Rightarrow r\n\\]\n\nThis expression represents a proposition of the form ‘if \\( p \\) and \\( q \\), then \\( r \\)’, where \\( p, q, r \\) are themselves propositions. It is built from the subformula \\( p \\land q \\) and \\( r \\) using the logical operator \\(\\Rightarrow\\), and \\( p \\land q \\) is itself built up from the subformulae \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) using the logical operator \\(\\land\\).\n\nThe truth value of \\((p \\land q) \\Rightarrow r\\) is then determined by the truth values of the constituent propositional variables (\\( p, q \\) and \\( r \\)) according to the rules for the logical operators \\(\\land\\) and \\(\\Rightarrow\\).\n</markdown>",

Unfortunately if all we have to work with is propositions then our ability to do mathematical reasoning will be halted pretty quickly. For example, consider the following statement:\n\n\\[ x \\text{ is divisible by } 7 \\]\n\nThis statement seems like the kind of thing we should probably be able to work with if we’re doing mathematics. It makes sense if \\( x \\) is an integer, such as 28 or 41; but it doesn’t make sense at all if \\( x \\) is a parrot called Alex.[^1] In any case, even when it does make sense, its truth value depends on \\( x \\); indeed, ‘28 is divisible by 7’ is a true proposition, but ‘41 is divisible by 7’ is a false proposition.\n\nThis means that the statement ‘\\( x \\) is divisible by 7’ isn’t a proposition—*quel horreur*! But it *almost* is a proposition: if we know that \\( x \\) refers somehow to an integer, then it becomes a proposition as soon as a particular numerical value of \\( x \\) is specified. The symbol \\( x \\) is called a *free variable*.\n\n✦ **Definition 1.2.1**  \nLet \\( x \\) be a variable that is understood to refer to an element of a set \\( X \\). In a statement involving \\( x \\), we say \\( x \\) is *free* if it makes sense to substitute particular elements of \\( X \\) in the statement; otherwise, we say \\( x \\) is *bound*.\n\nTo represent statements that have free variables in them abstractly, we generalise the notion of a propositional variable ([Definition 1.1.2](#)) to that of a *predicate*.\n\n✦ **Definition 1.2.2**  \nA *predicate* is a symbol \\( p \\) together with a specified list of free variables \\( x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n \\) (where \\( n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\)) and, for each free variable \\( x_i \\), a specification of a set \\( X_i \\) called the *domain of discourse* (or *range*) of \\( x_i \\). We will typically write \\( p(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n) \\) in order to make the variables explicit.\n\n[^1]: Alex the parrot is the only non-human animal to have ever been observed to ask an existential question; he died in September 2007 so we may never know if he was divisible by 7, but it is unlikely. According to *Time*, his last words were ‘you be good, see you tomorrow, I love you’. The reader is advised to finish crying before they continue reading about variables and quantifiers.\n</markdown>",

For example, ‘\\(x\\) is divisible by 7’ is not a proposition, but it becomes a proposition when specific integers (such as 28 or 41) are substituted for \\(x\\).\n\nThis is a lot to take in, so let’s look at some examples.\n\n✐ **Example 1.2.3**\n\n(i) We can represent the statement ‘\\(x\\) is divisible by 7’ discussed above by a predicate \\(p(x)\\) whose only free variable \\(x\\) has \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) as its domain of discourse. Then \\(p(28)\\) is the true proposition ‘28 is divisible by 7’ and \\(p(41)\\) is the false proposition ‘41 is divisible by 7’.\n\n(ii) A predicate with no free variables is precisely a propositional variable. This means that the notion of a predicate generalises that of a propositional variable.\n\n(iii) The expression ‘\\(2^n - 1\\) is prime’ can be represented by a predicate \\(p(n)\\) with one free variable \\(n\\), whose domain of discourse is the set \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) of natural numbers. Then \\(p(3)\\) is the true proposition ‘\\(2^3 - 1\\) is prime’ and \\(p(4)\\) is the false proposition ‘\\(2^4 - 1\\) is prime’.\n\n(iv) The expression ‘\\(x - y\\) is rational’ can be represented by a predicate \\(q(x, y)\\) with free variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), whose domain of discourse is the set \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) of real numbers.\n\n(v) The expression ‘there exist integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(x = a^2 + b^2\\)’ has free variable \\(x\\) and bound variables \\(a, b\\). It can be represented by a predicate \\(r(x)\\) with one free variable \\(x\\), whose domain of discourse is \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\).\n\n(vi) The expression ‘every even natural number \\(n \\geq 2\\) is divisible by \\(k\\)’ has free variable \\(k\\) and bound variable \\(n\\). It can be represented by a predicate \\(s(k)\\) with one free variable \\(k\\), whose domain of discourse is \\(\\mathbb{N}\\).\n\n### Quantifiers\n\nLook again at the statements in parts (v) and (vi) of **Example 1.2.3**. Both contained bound variables, which were so because we used words like ‘there exists’ and ‘every’—had we not used these words, those variables would be free, as in ‘\\(x = a^2 + b^2\\)’ and ‘\\(n\\) is divisible by \\(k\\)’.\n\nExpressions that refer to *how many* elements of a set make a statement true, such as ‘there exists’ and ‘every’, turn free variables into bound variables. We represent such expressions using symbols called *quantifiers*, which are the central objects of study of this section.\n</markdown>",

However, we can distill the robotic nature of the symbol-for-symbol reading by thinking more carefully about what the statement *really* means.\n\nIndeed, to say ‘\\( a = b^2 \\) for some real number \\( b \\)’ is exactly to say that \\( a \\) has a real square root—after all, what is a square root of \\( a \\) if not a real number whose square is equal to \\( a \\)?

The issue with the word ‘the’ here is that we don’t know ahead of time whether a natural number \\( n \\) may have base-\\( b \\) expansions other than \\( d_r d_{r-1} \\ldots d_1 d_0 \\)—this fact actually requires proof. To prove this fact, we would need to assume that \\( e_s e_{s-1} \\ldots e_1 e_0 \\) were another base-\\( b \\) expansion of \\( n \\), and prove that the strings \\( d_r d_{r-1} \\ldots d_1 d_0 \\) and \\( e_s e_{s-1} \\ldots e_1 e_0 \\) are the same—this is done in [Theorem 7.3.51](#).\n\nUniqueness is typically coupled with existence, since we usually want to know if there is exactly one object satisfying a property. This motivates the definition of the unique existential quantifier, which encodes what we mean when we say ‘there is exactly one \\( x \\in X \\) such that \\( p(x) \\) is true’. The ‘existence’ part ensures that at least one \\( x \\in X \\) makes \\( p(x) \\) true; the ‘uniqueness’ part ensures that \\( x \\) is the only element of \\( X \\) making \\( p(x) \\) true.\n\n✦ **Definition 1.2.26**\n\nThe **unique existential quantifier** is the quantifier \\(\\exists!\\) ([\\(\\LaTeX\\) code: `\\exists!`]) defined such that \\(\\exists! x \\in X, p(x)\\) is shorthand for\n\n\\[\n(\\exists x \\in X, p(x)) \\land (\\forall a \\in X, \\forall b \\in X, [(p(a) \\land p(b)) \\Rightarrow a = b])\n\\]\n\n✐ **Example 1.2.27**\n\nEvery positive real number has a unique positive square root.

Can you think of any other ways that \\( \\exists! x \\in X, p(x) \\) could be defined?\n\n### Strategy 1.2.29 (Proving unique-existentially quantified statements)\n\nA proof of a statement of the form \\( \\exists! x \\in X, p(x) \\), consists of two parts:\n\n- **Existence** — prove that \\( \\exists x \\in X, p(x) \\) is true (e.g. using [Strategy 1.2.18](#));\n- **Uniqueness** — let \\( a, b \\in X \\), assume that \\( p(a) \\) and \\( p(b) \\) are true, and derive \\( a = b \\).\n\nAlternatively, prove existence to obtain a fixed \\( a \\in X \\) such that \\( p(a) \\) is true, and then prove \\( \\forall x \\in X, [p(x) \\Rightarrow x = a] \\).\n\n### Example 1.2.30\n\nWe prove [Example 1.2.27](#), namely that for each real \\( a > 0 \\) there is a unique \\( b > 0 \\) such that \\( b^2 = a \\). So first fix \\( a > 0 \\).\n\n- **(Existence)** The real number \\( \\sqrt{a} \\) is positive and satisfies \\( (\\sqrt{a})^2 = a \\) by definition. Its existence will be deferred to a later time, but an informal argument for its existence could be provided using ‘number line’ arguments as in Chapter 0.\n\n- **(Uniqueness)** Let \\( y, z > 0 \\) be real numbers such that \\( y^2 = a \\) and \\( z^2 = a \\). Then \\( y^2 = z^2 \\). Rearranging and factorising yields\n\n  \\[\n  (y - z)(y + z) = 0\n  \\]\n\n  so either \\( y - z = 0 \\) or \\( y + z = 0 \\). If \\( y + z = 0 \\) then \\( z = -y \\), and since \\( y > 0 \\), this means that \\( z < 0 \\). But this contradicts the assumption that \\( z > 0 \\). As such, it must be the case that \\( y - z = 0 \\), and hence \\( y = z \\), as required.\n\n### Exercise 1.2.31\n\nFor each of the propositions, write it out as a logical formula involving the \\( \\exists! \\) quantifier and then prove it, using the structure of the logical formula as a guide.\n\n(a) For each real number \\( a \\), the equation \\( x^2 + 2ax + a^2 = 0 \\) has exactly one real solution \\( x \\).\n\n(b) There is a unique real number \\( a \\) for which the equation \\( x^2 + a^2 = 0 \\) has a real solution \\( x \\).\n\n(c) There is a unique natural number with exactly one positive divisor.\n</markdown>",

These statements are evidently equivalent—they mean the same thing—but they suggest different proof strategies:\n\n1. Fix a prime number \\( n \\), assume that \\( n > 2 \\), and then prove that \\( n = 2k + 1 \\) for some \\( k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\).\n\n2. Assume that there is some prime number \\( n \\) such that \\( n > 2 \\) and \\( n = 2k \\) for some \\( k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\), and derive a contradiction.\n\nWhile statement (1) more directly translates the plain English statement ‘every prime number greater than two is odd’, it is the proof strategy suggested by (2) that is easier to use. Indeed, if \\( n \\) is a prime number such that \\( n > 2 \\) and \\( n = 2k \\) for some \\( k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\), then 2 is a divisor of \\( n \\) other than 1 and \\( n \\) (since \\( 1 < 2 < n \\)), contradicting the assumption that \\( n \\) is prime.\n\nThe notion of **logical equivalence**, captures precisely the sense in which the logical formulae in (1) and (2) in Example 1.3.1 ‘mean the same thing’. Being able to transform a logical formula into a different (but equivalent) form allows us to identify a wider range of feasible proof strategies.\n\n### Definition 1.3.2\n\nLet \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) be logical formulae.

Hence \\(p \\Rightarrow q\\) is true.\n\nWe have derived \\((\\neg p) \\lor q\\) from \\(p \\Rightarrow q\\) and vice versa, and so the two formulae are logically equivalent.\n\n**Exercise 1.3.5**  \nLet \\(p, q\\) and \\(r\\) be propositional variables. Prove that the propositional formula \\((p \\lor q) \\Rightarrow r\\) is logically equivalent to \\((p \\Rightarrow r) \\land (q \\Rightarrow r)\\).\n\nWorking through the derivations each time we want to prove logical equivalence can become cumbersome even for small examples like Examples 1.3.3 and 1.3.4 and Exercise 1.3.5.\n\nThe following theorem reduces the problem of proving logical equivalence between propositional formulae to the purely algorithmic task of checking when the formulae are true and when they are false in a (relatively) small list of cases. We will streamline this process even further using truth tables (Definition 1.3.7).\n\n**Theorem 1.3.6**  \nTwo propositional formulae are logically equivalent if and only if their truth values are the same under any assignment of truth values to their constituent propositional variables.\n\n**Idea of proof**  \nA formal proof of this fact is slightly beyond our reach at this point, although we will be able to prove it formally by structural induction, introduced in Section 12.2.\n\nThe idea of the proof is that, since propositional formulae are built up from simpler propositional formulae using logical operators, the truth value of a more complex propositional formula is determined by the truth values of its simpler subformulae. If we keep ‘chasing’ these subformulae, we end up with just propositional variables.\n\nFor example, the truth value of \\((p \\Rightarrow r) \\land (q \\Rightarrow r)\\) is determined by the truth values of \\(p \\Rightarrow r\\) and \\(q \\Rightarrow r\\) according to the rules for the conjunction operator \\(\\land\\). In turn, the truth value of \\(p \\Rightarrow r\\) is determined by the truth values of \\(p\\) and \\(r\\) according to the implication.\n</markdown>",

Then:\n\n(a) \\(\\neg \\forall x \\in X, \\, p(x) \\equiv \\exists x \\in X, \\, \\neg p(x)\\); and\n\n(b) \\(\\neg \\exists x \\in X, \\, p(x) \\equiv \\forall x \\in X, \\, \\neg p(x)\\).\n\n**Proof**\n\nUnfortunately, since these logical formulae involve quantifiers, we do not have truth tables at our disposal, so we must assume each formula and derive the other.\n\nWe start by proving the equivalence in part (b), and then we derive (a) as a consequence.\n\n- Assume \\(\\neg \\exists x \\in X, \\, p(x)\\). To prove \\(\\forall x \\in X, \\, \\neg p(x)\\), fix some \\( x \\in X \\). If \\( p(x) \\) were true, then we’d have \\(\\exists x \\in X, \\, p(x)\\), which contradicts our main assumption; so we have \\(\\neg p(x)\\). But then \\(\\forall x \\in X, \\, \\neg p(x)\\) is true.\n\n- Assume \\(\\forall x \\in X, \\, \\neg p(x)\\). For the sake of contradiction, assume \\(\\exists x \\in X, \\, p(x)\\) were true. Then we obtain some \\( a \\in X \\) for which \\( p(a) \\) is true. But \\(\\neg p(a)\\) is true by the assumption that \\(\\forall x \\in X, \\, \\neg p(a)\\), so we obtain a contradiction. Hence \\(\\neg \\exists x \\in X, \\, p(x)\\) is true.\n\nThis proves that \\(\\neg \\exists x \\in X, \\, p(x) \\equiv \\forall x \\in X, \\, \\neg p(x)\\).\n\nNow (a) follows from (b) using the law of double negation ([Theorem 1.3.15](#)):\n\n\\[\n\\exists x \\in X, \\, \\neg p(x) \\equiv \\neg \\neg \\exists x \\in X, \\, \\neg p(x) \\overset{(b)}{\\equiv} \\neg \\forall x \\in X, \\, \\neg \\neg p(x) \\equiv \\neg \\forall x \\in X, \\, p(x)\n\\]\n\nas required.\n\nThe proof strategy suggested by the logical equivalence in Theorem 1.3.28(b) is so important that it has its own name.\n\n### Strategy 1.3.29 (Proof by counterexample)\n\nTo prove that a proposition of the form \\(\\forall x \\in X, \\, p(x)\\) is false, it suffices to find a single element \\( a \\in X \\) such that \\( p(a) \\) is false. The element \\( a \\) is called a **counterexample** to the proposition \\(\\forall x \\in X, \\, p(x)\\).\n\n### Example 1.3.30\n\nWe prove by counterexample that not every integer is divisible by a prime number. Indeed, let \\( x = 1 \\). The only integral factors of 1 are 1 and \\(-1\\), neither of which are prime, so that 1 is not divisible by any primes.\n\n### Exercise 1.3.31\n\nProve by counterexample that not every rational number can be expressed as \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) where \\( a \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\) is even and \\( b \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\) is odd.\n</markdown>",

Logical equivalence\n\n### Idea of proof\n\nMuch like [Theorem 1.3.6](#), a precise proof of [Theorem 1.3.35](#) requires some form of induction argument, so instead we will give an idea of the proof.\n\nEvery logical formula we have seen so far is built from predicates using the logical operators \\(\\land, \\lor, \\Rightarrow\\) and \\(\\lnot\\) and the quantifiers \\(\\forall\\) and \\(\\exists\\)—indeed, the logical operator \\(\\Leftrightarrow\\) was defined in terms of \\(\\land\\) and \\(\\Rightarrow\\), and the quantifier \\(\\exists\\) was defined in terms of the quantifiers \\(\\forall\\) and \\(\\land\\) and the logical operators \\(\\land\\) and \\(\\Rightarrow\\).\n\nBut the results in this section allow us to push negations ‘inside’ each of these logical operators and quantifiers, as summarised in the following table.\n\n| Negation outside | Negation inside | Proof              |\n|------------------|-----------------|--------------------|\n| \\(\\lnot(p \\land q)\\) | \\((\\lnot p) \\lor (\\lnot q)\\) | Theorem 1.3.24(a) |\n| \\(\\lnot(p \\lor q)\\)  | \\((\\lnot p) \\land (\\lnot q)\\) | Theorem 1.3.24(b) |\n| \\(\\lnot(p \\Rightarrow q)\\) | \\(p \\land (\\lnot q)\\) | Exercise 1.3.27   |\n| \\(\\lnot(\\lnot p)\\) | \\(p\\) | Theorem 1.3.15       |\n| \\(\\lnot \\forall x \\in X, p(x)\\) | \\(\\exists x \\in X, \\lnot p(x)\\) | Theorem 1.3.28(a) |\n| \\(\\lnot \\exists x \\in X, p(x)\\) | \\(\\forall x \\in X, \\lnot p(x)\\) | Theorem 1.3.28(b) |\n\nRepeatedly applying these rules to a logical formula eventually yields a logically equivalent, maximally negated logical formula.\n\n### Example 1.3.36\n\nRecall the logical formula from page 71 expressing the assertion that a sequence \\(x_0, x_1, x_2, \\ldots\\) of real numbers converges:\n\n\\[\n\\exists a \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\forall \\varepsilon \\in \\mathbb{R}, (\\varepsilon > 0 \\Rightarrow \\exists N \\in \\mathbb{N}, \\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N}, [n \\geq N \\Rightarrow |x_n - a| < \\varepsilon])\n\\]\n\nWe will maximally negate this to obtain a logical formula expressing the assertion that the sequence does not converge.\n\nLet’s start at the beginning. The negation of the formula we started with is:\n\n\\[\n\\lnot \\exists a \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\forall \\varepsilon \\in \\mathbb{R}, (\\varepsilon > 0 \\Rightarrow \\exists N \\in \\mathbb{N}, \\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N}, [n \\geq N \\Rightarrow |x_n - a| < \\varepsilon])\n\\]\n\nThe key to maximally negating a logical formula is to ignore information that is not immediately relevant. Here, the expression that we are negating takes the form \\(\\lnot \\exists a \\in \\mathbb{R}, (\\text{stuff})\\). It doesn’t matter what the ‘stuff’ is just yet; all that matters is that we are negating an existentially quantified statement, and so de Morgan’s laws for quantifiers tells us that this is logically equivalent to \\(\\forall a \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\lnot(\\text{stuff})\\). We apply this rule and just re-write the ‘stuff’, to obtain:\n\n\\[\n\\forall a \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\lnot \\forall \\varepsilon \\in \\mathbb{R}, (\\varepsilon > 0 \\Rightarrow \\exists N \\in \\mathbb{N}, \\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N}, [n \\geq N \\Rightarrow |x_n - a| < \\varepsilon])\n\\]\n</markdown>",

The word ‘tautology’ has other implications when used colloquially, but in the context of symbolic logic it has a precise definition.\n\n### Definition 1.3.39\nA **tautology** is a proposition or logical formula that is true, no matter how truth values are assigned to its component propositional variables and predicates.\n\nThe reason we are interested in tautologies is that tautologies can be used as assumptions at any point in a proof, for any reason.\n\n### Strategy 1.3.40 (Assuming tautologies)\nLet \\( p \\) be a proposition. Any tautology may be assumed in any proof of \\( p \\).\n\n### Example 1.3.41\nThe law of excluded middle (Axiom 1.1.44) says precisely that \\( p \\lor (\\neg p) \\) is a tautology. This means that when proving any result, we may split into cases based on whether a proposition is true or false, just as we did in Proposition 1.1.46.\n\n### Example 1.3.42\nThe formula \\( p \\Rightarrow (q \\Rightarrow p) \\) is a tautology.\n\nA direct proof of this fact is as follows. In order to prove \\( p \\Rightarrow (q \\Rightarrow p) \\) is true, it suffices to assume \\( p \\) and derive \\( q \\Rightarrow p \\). So assume \\( p \\). Now in order to prove \\( q \\Rightarrow p \\), it suffices to assume \\( q \\) and derive \\( p \\). So assume \\( q \\). But we’re already assuming that \\( p \\) is true!

        "content": "<markdown>\n## Section 2.1\n\n# Sets\n\nWe begin by redefining the notion of a **set** with a notch more precision than we provided in Chapter 0. At their core, sets seem extremely simple—sets are just collections of objects—except that if not kept in check, this characterisation of a set leads to logical inconsistencies, such as the infamous *Russell’s paradox*.\n\nThese logical paradoxes can be overcome by restricting ourselves to working inside a universe \\(\\mathcal{U}\\), which we consider to be a set which is so big that it contains all of the mathematical objects that we want to talk about. This is a subtle issue, which is well beyond the scope of this section, but is discussed further in Section B.1.\n\n### Definition 2.1.1\n\nA **set** is a collection of **elements** from a specified **universe of discourse**. The collection of everything in the universe of discourse is called the **universal set**, denoted by \\(\\mathcal{U}\\) (LaTeX code: `\\mathcal{U}`).\n\nThe expression \\(x \\in X\\) (LaTeX code: `\\in`) denotes the statement that \\(x\\) is an element of \\(X\\); we write \\(x \\notin X\\) (LaTeX code: `\\not\\in`) to mean \\(\\neg (x \\in X)\\), that is that \\(x\\) is not an element of \\(X\\).\n\n### Example 2.1.2\n\nIn Chapter 0, we introduced five sets: the set \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) of natural numbers, the set \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) of integers, the set \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) of rational numbers, the set \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) of real numbers and the set \\(\\mathbb{C}\\) of complex numbers.\n\n### Exercise 2.1.3\n\nWhich of the following propositions are true, and which are false?\n\n- \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\)\n- \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\)\n- \\(Z \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\)\n- \\(Z \\in \\mathcal{U}\\)\n- \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\in \\mathcal{U}\\)\n\nWe will avoid referring explicitly to the universal set \\(\\mathcal{U}\\) whenever possible, but it will always be there in the background. This is convenient because we no longer need to worry about the domain of discourse of free variables (as we did in Definition 1.2.2), so that we can abbreviate ‘\\(\\forall x \\in \\mathcal{U}, p(x)\\)’ by ‘\\(\\forall x, p(x)\\)’, and ‘\\(\\exists x \\in \\mathcal{U}, p(x)\\)’ by ‘\\(\\exists x, p(x)\\)’.\n\nNote that under this convention:\n\n- \\(\\forall x \\in X, p(x)\\) is logically equivalent to \\(\\forall x, (x \\in X \\Rightarrow p(x))\\); and\n- \\(\\exists x \\in X, p(x)\\) is logically equivalent to \\(\\exists x, (x \\in X \\land p(x))\\).\n</markdown>",

There are other, more concise ways of specifying sets, which also remove such ambiguity from the process.\n\n**Lists.** One way is simply to provide a list of the elements of the set. To specify that the list denotes a set, we enclose the list with {curly brackets} (LaTeX code: `\\{, \\}`). For example, the following is a specification of a set \\( X \\), whose elements are the natural numbers between 0 and 5 (inclusive):\n\n\\[ \nX = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\} \n\\]\n\n**Implied lists.** Sometimes a list might be too long to write out—maybe even infinite—or the length of the list might depend on a variable. In these cases it will be convenient to use an implied list, in which some elements of the list are written, and the rest are left implicit by writing an ellipsis ‘…’ (LaTeX code: `\\dots`). For example, the statement\n\n\\[ \nX = \\{1, 4, 9, \\dots, n^2\\} \n\\]\n\nmeans that \\( X \\) is the set whose elements are all the square numbers from 1 to \\( n^2 \\), where \\( n \\) is some number. Implied lists can be ambiguous, since they rely on the reader’s ability to infer the pattern being followed, so use with caution!\n\n**Set-builder notation.** In general, implied lists can be ambiguous, so in practice they are avoided unless the implied list is very simple, such as a set of consecutive numbers like \\(\\{3, 4, \\dots, 9\\}\\). In fact, many sets can’t even be listed in this way.\n\nTo get around this, we can use **set-builder notation**, which is a means of specifying a set in terms of the properties its elements satisfy. Given a set \\( X \\), the set of elements of \\( X \\) satisfying some property \\( p(x) \\) is denoted\n\n\\[ \n\\{x \\in X \\mid p(x)\\} \n\\]\n\nThe bar ‘\\(\\mid\\)’ (LaTeX code: `\\mid`) separates the variable name from the formula that they make true—some authors use a colon instead (as in \\(\\{x \\in X : p(x)\\}\\)).\n\nThe set \\(\\{x \\in X \\mid p(x)\\}\\) is read aloud as ‘the set of \\( x \\in X \\) such that \\( p(x) \\)’, but beware—neither the bar ‘\\(\\mid\\)’ nor the colon ‘:’ mean ‘such that’ in other contexts.\n\n✎ **Example 2.1.4**  \nThe set of all even integers can be written in set-builder notation as\n\n\\[ \n\\{n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid n \\text{ is even}\\} \n\\]\n</markdown>",

But we have to be slightly careful about how we use the word ‘the’, since it implies uniqueness, and we don’t know (yet) that two sets with no elements are necessarily equal. So first we will define what it means for a set to be empty, and then we’ll show that there is exactly one empty set.\n\n### Definition 2.1.27\nA set \\(X\\) is **inhabited** (or **nonempty**) if it has at least one element; otherwise, it is **empty**.\n\nThe assertion that \\(X\\) is inhabited is equivalent to the logical formula \\(\\exists a, a \\in X\\), and the assertion that \\(X\\) is empty is equivalent to the logical formula \\(\\neg \\exists a, a \\in X\\). This suggests the following strategy for proving that a set is inhabited, or that it is empty.\n\n### Strategy 2.1.28 (Proving that a set is inhabited or empty)\nIn order to prove a set \\(X\\) is inhabited, it suffices to exhibit an element. In order to prove a set \\(X\\) is empty, assume that \\(X\\) is inhabited—that is, that there is some element \\(a \\in X\\)—and derive a contradiction.\n\nIn other texts, the term **nonempty** is more common than **inhabited**, but there are reasons to prefer the latter. Indeed, the statement ‘\\(X\\) is non-empty’ translates more directly to \\(\\neg (\\neg \\exists a, a \\in X)\\), which has an unnecessary double-negative and suggests a proof of inhabitation by contradiction. For this reason, we use the term **inhabited** in this book.\n\nEmptiness may seem like a trivial condition—and it is—but owing to its canonicity, it arises all over the place.\n\n### Example 2.1.29\nThe set \\(\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid x^2 = 2\\}\\) is inhabited since, for example, \\(\\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{2}^2 = 2\\). However, the set \\(\\{x \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\mid x^2 = 2\\}\\) is empty since, if it were inhabited, then there would be a rational number \\(x\\) such that \\(x^2 = 2\\), contrary to Proposition 0.28.\n\n### Example 2.1.30\nWe observed in Example 2.1.10 that the set \\([0]\\) is empty; here’s a more formal proof.\n</markdown>",

As we will see in subsequent chapters of this book, functions are central in almost every area of mathematical study: they allow us to transform elements of one set into elements of another, to define ‘infinity’, and to capture real-world notions such as probability and randomness in the abstract.\n\nIt is likely (but not assumed) that you have seen functions before, such as real-valued functions in calculus or linear transformations in linear algebra. However, we will study functions in the abstract; the ‘inputs’ and ‘outputs’ of our functions need not be numbers, vectors or points in space; they can be anything at all—in fact, the inputs or outputs to our functions might themselves be functions!\n\nWe introduce the notion of a function abstractly in Section 3.1. Much of our time will be spent developing basic notions involving functions, including graphs, composition, images and preimages.\n\nWe will zoom in on two properties in particular in Section 3.2, namely injectivity and surjectivity. These properties allow us to compare the sizes of sets we will use them extensively in Chapters 8 and 10 for doing exactly that.\n</markdown>",

It is surjective (or onto) if for every \\( b \\in B \\), there exists at least one \\( a \\in A \\) such that \\( f(a) = b \\). The significance of these properties lies in their ability to determine whether a function can be reversed (injectivity) and whether all elements in the codomain are accounted for (surjectivity), which are essential for comparing the sizes of the sets involved."

        "content": "<markdown>\n## Section 3.1\n\n# Functions\n\nOne way of studying interactions between sets is by studying *functions* between them, which we will define informally in [Definition 3.1.1](#). Functions are mathematical objects which assign to each element of one set exactly one element of another. Almost every branch of mathematics studies functions, be it directly or indirectly, and almost every application of mathematics arises from a translation of the abstract notion of a function to the real world. Just one example of this is the theory of computation—functions provide precisely the language necessary to describe the deterministic input-output behaviour of algorithms.\n\nYou might have come across the notion of a function before now. In schools, functions are often introduced as being like *machines*—they have inputs and outputs, and on a given input they always return the same output. For instance, there is a function which takes integers as inputs and gives integers as outputs, which on the input \\( x \\) returns the integer \\( x + 3 \\).\n\nThis characterisation of functions, however, is clearly not precise enough for the purposes of mathematical proof. A next approximation to a precise definition of a function might look something like this:\n\n### Definition 3.1.1\n\nA function \\( f \\) from a set \\( X \\) to a set \\( Y \\) is a specification of elements \\( f(x) \\in Y \\) for \\( x \\in X \\), such that\n\n\\[\n\\forall x \\in X, \\exists! y \\in Y, y = f(x)\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( x \\in X \\), the (unique!) element \\( f(x) \\in Y \\) is called the *value* of \\( f \\) at \\( x \\).\n\nThe set \\( X \\) is called the *domain* (or *source*) of \\( f \\), and \\( Y \\) is called the *codomain* (or *target*) of \\( f \\). We write \\( f : X \\rightarrow Y \\) (\\LaTeX{} code: \\( f : X \\to Y \\)) to denote the assertion that \\( f \\) is a function with domain \\( X \\) and codomain \\( Y \\).\n\nThis is better—we’re now talking about sets, and not mysterious ‘machines’.\n\nMoreover, this definition establishes a close relationship between functions and the \\(\\exists!\\) quantifier: indeed, to say that \\( f \\) assigns to each element of \\( X \\) a unique element of \\( Y \\) is to say precisely that\n\n\\[\n\\forall x \\in X, \\exists! y \\in Y, y = f(x)\n\\]\n\nConversely, any true proposition of the form \\(\\forall x \\in X, \\exists! y \\in Y, p(x,y)\\) defines a function.\n</markdown>",
        "Q": "Q: What is the relationship between the domain and codomain of a function \\( f : X \\to Y \\) according to the definition provided? ",
        "A": " A: The domain \\( X \\) is the set of inputs for the function, while the codomain \\( Y \\) is the set of potential outputs. Each element in \\( X \\) is assigned exactly one element in \\( Y \\) by the function \\( f \\)."

Functions\n\n\\( f : X \\to Y \\): the function \\( f \\) assigns to each \\( x \\in X \\) the unique \\( y \\in Y \\) such that \\( p(x,y) \\) is true. In other words, \\(\\forall x \\in X, p(x, f(x))\\) is true!\n\nWe can use this to generate some examples of functions.\n\n#### Example 3.1.2\nExample 1.2.27 said that every positive real number has a unique positive square root; we proved this in Example 1.2.30. What this means is that there is a function\n\n\\[\nr : \\mathbb{R}^{>0} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{>0} \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\mathbb{R}^{>0} = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid x > 0\\}\n\\]\n\ndefined by letting \\( r(x) \\) be the (unique) positive square root of \\( x \\), for each \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{>0} \\). That is, we have a function \\( r \\) defined by \\( r(x) = \\sqrt{x} \\).\n\n#### Exercise 3.1.3\nRecall Exercise 1.2.31. Which of the statements (a), (b) or (c) is of the form \\(\\forall x \\in X, \\exists! y \\in Y, p(x,y)\\)? For each statement of this form, determine the domain and codomain of the corresponding function, and write an expression defining this function.\n\n### Specifying a function\n\nJust like with sets, there are many ways to specify a function \\( f : X \\to Y \\), but when we do so, we must be careful that what we write really *does* define a function!\n\nThis correctness of specification is known as *well-definedness*, and ultimately amounts to verifying that the condition \\(\\forall x \\in X, \\exists! y \\in Y, f(x) = y\\) holds for the specification of \\( f \\). Namely *totality*, *existence* and *uniqueness*:\n\n- **Totality.** A value \\( f(x) \\) should be specified for each \\( x \\in X \\)—this corresponds to the ‘\\(\\forall x \\in X\\)’ quantifier in the definition of functions.\n\n- **Existence.** For each \\( x \\in X \\), the specified value \\( f(x) \\) should actually exist, and should be an element of \\( Y \\)—this corresponds to the *existence* part of the ‘\\(\\exists! y \\in Y\\)’ quantifier in the definition of functions.\n\n- **Uniqueness.** For each \\( x \\in X \\), the specified value \\( f(x) \\) should refer to only one element of \\( Y \\)—this corresponds to the *uniqueness* part of the ‘\\(\\exists! y \\in Y\\)’ quantifier in the definition of functions.\n\nWhen specifying a function, you should justify each of these components of well-definedness unless they are extremely obvious. You will probably find that, in most cases, the only component in need of justification is uniqueness, but keep all three in mind.\n</markdown>",

        "content": "<markdown>\n### Lists\n\nIf \\( X \\) is finite, then we can specify a function \\( f : X \\to Y \\) by simply listing the values of \\( f \\) at all possible elements \\( x \\in X \\). For example, we can define a function\n\n\\[\nf : \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\to \\{\\text{red, yellow, green, blue, purple}\\}\n\\]\n\nby declaring\n\n\\[\nf(1) = \\text{red}, \\quad f(2) = \\text{purple}, \\quad f(3) = \\text{green}\n\\]\n\nNote that the function is at this point completely specified: we know its values at all elements of the domain \\(\\{1, 2, 3\\}\\). It doesn’t matter that some of the elements of the codomain (yellow and blue) are unaccounted for—all that matters is that each element of the domain is associated with exactly one element of the codomain.\n\nUnfortunately, most of the sets that we work with will be infinite, or of an unspecified finite size; in these cases, simply writing a list of values isn’t sufficient. Fortunately for us, there are other ways of specifying functions.\n\n### Formulae\n\nIn many cases, particularly when the domain \\( X \\) and codomain \\( Y \\) are number sets, we can define a function by giving a formula for the value of \\( f(x) \\) for each \\( x \\in X \\). For example, we can define a function \\( f : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) by letting\n\n\\[\nf(x) = x^2 + 3 \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in \\mathbb{R}\n\\]\n\n### By cases\n\nIt will at times be convenient to define a function using different specifications for different elements of the domain. A very simple example is the absolute value function \\(|\\cdot| : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}\\), defined for \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\)\n\n\\[\n|x| = \n\\begin{cases} \nx & \\text{if } x \\geq 0 \\\\\n-x & \\text{if } x \\leq 0 \n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nHere we have split into two cases based on the conditions \\( x \\geq 0 \\) and \\( x \\leq 0 \\).\n\nWhen specifying a function \\( f : X \\to Y \\) by cases, it is important that the conditions be:\n\n- **exhaustive**: given \\( x \\in X \\), at least one of the conditions on \\( X \\) must hold; and\n- **compatible**: if any \\( x \\in X \\) satisfies more than one condition, the specified value must be the same no matter which condition is picked.\n\nFor the absolute value function defined above, these conditions are satisfied. Indeed, for \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\), it is certainly the case that \\( x \\geq 0 \\) or \\( x \\leq 0 \\), so the conditions are exhaustive. Moreover, given \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\), if both \\( x \\geq 0 \\) and \\( x \\leq 0 \\), then \\( x = 0 \\)—so we need to check that the specification yields the same value when \\( x = 0 \\) regardless of which condition we pick. The \\( x \\geq 0 \\) condition yields the value 0, and the \\( x \\leq 0 \\) condition yields the value \\(-0\\), which is equal to 0—so the conditions are compatible.

This 'machine' is defined by saying what the possible inputs and outputs are, and then providing a list of instructions (an *algorithm*) for the machine to follow, which on any input produces an output—and, moreover, if fed the same input, the machine always produces the same output.\n\nFor example, we might instruct a machine to take rational numbers as inputs and give rational numbers as outputs, and to follow the following sequence of steps on a given input\n\nmultiply by 2 \\(\\rightarrow\\) add 5 \\(\\rightarrow\\) square the result \\(\\rightarrow\\) divide by 6\n\nThis 'machine' defines a function \\( M : \\mathbb{Q} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Q} \\) which, in equation form, is specified by\n\n\\[\nM(x) = \\frac{(2x + 5)^2}{6} \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in \\mathbb{Q}\n\\]\n\nIn our more formal set-up, therefore, we can define a function \\( M : I \\rightarrow O \\) by specifying:\n\n- a set \\( I \\) of all *inputs*;\n- a set \\( O \\) of potential *outputs*; and\n- a deterministic[^a] algorithm which describes how an input \\( x \\in I \\) is transformed into an output \\( M(x) \\in O \\).\n\nThat is, the domain is the set \\( I \\) of all possible 'inputs', the codomain is a set \\( O \\) containing all the possible 'outputs', and the function \\( M \\) is a rule specifying how an input is associated with the corresponding output.\n\nFor now, we will use algorithmic specifications of functions only sparingly—this is because it is much harder to make formal what is meant by an 'algorithm', and it is important to check that a given algorithm is deterministic.\n\n### Function equality\n\nIn [Section 2.1](#) we discussed how there may be many different possible ways of characterising equality of sets. This matter was resolved by declaring that two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements (this was [Axiom 2.1.22](#)).\n\n[^a]: The word 'deterministic' just means that the algorithm always produces the same output on a single input.\n</markdown>",

        "content": "<markdown>\nA similar matter arises for functions. For example, consider the function \\( f : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) defined by \\( f(x) = 2x \\) for all \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\), and the function \\( g : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\), defined by letting \\( g(x) \\) be the result of taking \\( x \\), multiplying it by three, dividing the result by four, dividing the result by six, and then multiplying the result by sixteen. It so happens that \\( g(x) = 2x \\) for all \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\) as well, but that is not how \\( g \\) is defined; moreover, if \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) were implemented as algorithms, then it would take longer to compute the values of \\( g \\) than it would take to compute the values of \\( f \\).\n\nShould we consider \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) to be *equal*? If we are only interested in whether \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) have the same values on each argument, then the answer should be ‘yes’; if we are interested in the algorithmic behaviour of \\( f \\) and \\( g \\), then the answer should be ‘no’.\n\nWe resolve this dilemma with the following axiom. By adopting this axiom, we are stating that the functions \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) discussed above are equal.\n\n### Axiom 3.1.4 (Function extensionality)\nLet \\( f : X \\to Y \\) and \\( g : A \\to B \\) be functions. Then \\( f = g \\) if and only if the following conditions hold:\n\n(i) \\( X = A \\) and \\( Y = B \\); and\n\n(ii) \\( f(x) = g(x) \\) for all \\( x \\in X \\).\n\n### Strategy 3.1.5 (Proving two functions are equal)\nGiven functions \\( f, g : X \\to Y \\) with the same domain and codomain, in order to prove that \\( f = g \\), it suffices to prove that \\( f(x) = g(x) \\) for all \\( x \\in X \\).\n\nA consequence of Axiom 3.1.4 is that, for fixed sets \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\), a function \\( X \\to Y \\) is uniquely determined by its input-output pairs. This set is called the *graph* of the function; the proof of the equivalence between functions and their graphs is the content of Theorem 3.1.9.\n\n### Definition 3.1.6\nLet \\( f : X \\to Y \\) be a function. The *graph* of \\( f \\) is the subset \\( \\mathrm{Gr}(f) \\subseteq X \\times Y \\) defined by\n\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Gr}(f) = \\{ (x, f(x)) \\mid x \\in X \\} = \\{ (x, y) \\in X \\times Y \\mid y = f(x) \\}\n\\]\n\n### Example 3.1.7\nGiven a (sufficiently well-behaved) function \\( f : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\), we can represent \\( \\mathrm{Gr}(f) \\subseteq \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\) by plotting it on a pair of axes using Cartesian coordinates in the usual way.

This unique \\( b \\) is precisely the positive square root \\(\\sqrt{a}\\) of \\( a \\). Writing \\(\\mathbb{R}^{>0}\\) for the set of positive real numbers, we have thus established that taking the positive square root defines a function \\(\\mathbb{R}^{>0} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{>0}\\).\n\nThere is a class of functions called **identity functions** that, despite being very simple, are so important that we will give them a numbered definition!\n\n### Definition 3.1.13\n\nLet \\( X \\) be a set. The **identity function** on \\( X \\) is the function \\(\\mathrm{id}_X : X \\to X\\) defined by \\(\\mathrm{id}_X(x) = x\\) for all \\( x \\in X \\).\n\nYou should convince yourself that the specification of \\(\\mathrm{id}_X\\) given in Definition 3.1.13 is well-defined.\n\nAnother interesting example of a function is the **empty function**, which is useful in coming up with counterexamples and proving combinatorial identities (see Section 8.1).\n\n### Definition 3.1.14\n\nLet \\( X \\) be a set. The **empty function** with codomain \\( X \\) is the (unique!) function \\(\\emptyset \\to X\\). It has no values, since there are no elements of its domain.\n\nAgain, you should convince yourself that this specification is well-defined. Conceptually, convincing yourself of this is not easy; but writing down the proof of well-definedness is extremely easy—you will find that there is simply nothing to prove!\n\n### Example 3.1.15\n\nDefine \\( f : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) by the equation \\( f(x)^2 = x \\) for all \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\). This is not well-defined for a few reasons. First, if \\( x < 0 \\) then there is no real number \\( y \\) such that \\( y^2 = x \\), so for \\( x < 0 \\) there are no possible values of \\( f(x) \\) in the codomain of \\( f \\), so **existence** fails. Second, if \\( x > 0 \\) then there are in fact two real numbers \\( y \\) such that \\( y^2 = x \\), namely the positive square root \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) and the negative square root \\(-\\sqrt{x}\\). The specification of \\( f \\) does not indicate which of these values to take, so **uniqueness** fails.\n\nNotice that the function \\( r : \\mathbb{R}^{>0} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{>0} \\) from Example 3.1.2 is (well-)defined by the equation \\( r(x)^2 = x \\) for all \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{>0} \\).

This is usually less useful for proving that a function is injective, but it does provide a good intuition—it says that \\( f \\) sends distinct inputs to distinct outputs.\n\nThe following is a very simple example from elementary arithmetic:\n\n### Example 3.2.3\nDefine \\( f : \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\) by letting \\( f(x) = 2n + 1 \\) for all \\( n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\). We’ll prove that \\( f \\) is injective. Fix \\( m, n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\), and assume that \\( f(m) = f(n) \\). By definition of \\( f \\), we have \\( 2m + 1 = 2n + 1 \\). Subtracting 1 yields \\( 2m = 2n \\), and dividing by 2 yields \\( m = n \\). Hence \\( f \\) is injective. \n\nThe following example is slightly more sophisticated.\n\n### Proposition 3.2.4\nLet \\( f : X \\to Y \\) and \\( g : Y \\to Z \\) be functions.

We will prove that \\( f \\) is a bijection.\n\n- **(Injectivity)** Fix \\( x, y \\in D \\) and suppose that \\( f(x) = f(y) \\). Then \\( \\frac{x}{2^k} = \\frac{y}{2^k} \\), so that \\( x = y \\), as required.\n\n- **(Surjectivity)** Fix \\( y \\in D \\). We need to find \\( x \\in D \\) such that \\( f(x) = y \\). Well certainly if \\( 2^k y \\in D \\) then we have\n\n  \\[\n  f(2^k y) = \\frac{2^k y}{2^k} = y\n  \\]\n\n  so it suffices to prove that \\( 2^k y \\in D \\). Since \\( y \\in D \\), we must have \\( y = \\frac{a}{2^n} \\) for some \\( n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\).\n\n  - If \\( k \\leq n \\) then \\( n - k \\in \\mathbb{N} \\) and so \\( 2^k y = \\frac{a}{2^{n-k}} \\in D \\).\n  - If \\( k > n \\) then \\( k - n > 0 \\) and \\( 2^k y = 2^{k-n} a \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\); but \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\subseteq D \\) since if \\( a \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\) then \\( a = \\frac{a}{2^0} \\).\n\n  So again we have \\( 2^k y \\in D \\).\n\nIn both cases we have \\( 2^k y \\in D \\); and \\( f(2^k y) = y \\), so that \\( f \\) is surjective.\n\nSince \\( f \\) is both injective and surjective, it is bijective.\n\n✎ **Exercise 3.2.19**  \nLet \\( X \\) be a set.

Prove that \\( f \\) is injective if and only if\n\n\\[\n\\forall y \\in f[X], \\exists! x \\in X, y = f(x)\n\\]\n\nThinking back to [Section 3.1](#), you might notice that this means that the logical formula ‘\\( y = f(x) \\)’ defines a function \\( f[X] \\to X \\)—specifically, if \\( f \\) is injective then there is a function \\( g : f[X] \\to X \\) which is (well-)defined by specifying \\( x = g(f(x)) \\) for all \\( x \\in X \\). Thinking of \\( f \\) as an encoding function, we then have that \\( g \\) is the corresponding decoding function—decoding is possible by injectivity of \\( f \\). (If \\( f \\) were not injective then distinct elements of \\( X \\) might have the same encoding, in which case we’re stuck if we try to decode them!)\n\n### Exercise 3.2.22\nDefine a function \\( e : \\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N} \\) by \\( e(m,n) = 2^m \\cdot 3^n \\). Prove that \\( e \\) is injective. We can think of \\( e \\) as encoding pairs of natural numbers as single natural numbers—for example, the pair \\( (4, 1) \\) is encoded as \\( 2^4 \\cdot 3^1 = 48 \\). For each of the following natural numbers \\( k \\), find the pairs of natural numbers encoded by \\( e \\) as \\( k \\):\n\n\\[\n1 \\quad 24 \\quad 7776 \\quad 59049 \\quad 396718580736\n\\]\n\nIn [Exercise 3.2.22](#), we were able to decode any natural number of the form \\( 2^m \\cdot 3^n \\) for \\( m, n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\). This process of decoding yields a function\n\n\\[\nd : \\{k \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid k = 2^m \\cdot 3^n \\text{ for some } m, n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} \\to \\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N}\n\\]\n\nWhat would happen if we tried to decode a natural number not of the form \\( 2^m \\cdot 3^n \\) for \\( m, n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\), say 5 or 100? Well… it doesn’t really matter! All we need to be true is that \\( d(e(m,n)) = (m,n) \\) for all \\( (m,n) \\in \\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N} \\); the value of \\( d \\) on other natural numbers is irrelevant.\n\n### Definition 3.2.23\nLet \\( f : X \\to Y \\) be a function.

The reason why \\( g \\) is well-defined is precisely injectivity of \\( f \\): if \\( y = f(x) \\) for some \\( x \\in X \\), then the value of \\( x \\in X \\) for which \\( y = f(x) \\) is unique. (Indeed, if \\( a \\in X \\) satisfied \\( y = f(a) \\), then we’d have \\( a = x \\) by injectivity of \\( f \\).)\n\nSo \\( g \\) is indeed well-defined. To see that \\( g \\) is a left inverse for \\( f \\), let \\( x \\in X \\). Letting \\( y = f(x) \\), we see that \\( y \\) falls into the first case in the specification of \\( g \\), so that \\( g(f(x)) = g(y) = a \\) for the value of \\( a \\in X \\) for which \\( y = f(a) \\)—but as noted above, we have \\( a = x \\) by injectivity of \\( f \\).\n\\end{proof}\n</markdown>",

Let’s examine what a proof of this fact would entail. The fact that \\( f : X \\to Y \\) is surjective can be expressed as\n\n\\[\n\\forall y \\in Y, \\exists x \\in X, f(x) = y\n\\]\n\nA right inverse would be a function \\( g : Y \\to X \\), so by Definition 3.1.1, it must satisfy the following condition\n\n\\[\n\\forall y \\in Y, \\exists! x \\in X, g(y) = x\n\\]\n\nThe temptation is therefore to construct \\( g : Y \\to X \\) as follows. Let \\( y \\in Y \\). By definition of surjectivity, there exists some \\( x \\in X \\) such that \\( f(x) = y \\)—define \\( g(y) \\) to be such an element \\( x \\). Then we have \\( f(g(y)) = f(x) = y \\), as required.\n\nThere is an extremely subtle—but important—issue with this construction.\n\nBy choosing \\( g(y) \\) to be a fixed element of \\( X \\) such that \\( f(x) = y \\), we are assuming ahead of time that there is a mechanism for choosing, for each \\( y \\in Y \\), a unique element of \\( f^{-1}[\\{y\\}] \\) to be the value of \\( g(y) \\). In other words we are assuming that some statement \\( R(x,y) \\) satisfies the property\n\n\\[\n\\forall y \\in Y, \\exists! x \\in X, [x \\in f^{-1}[\\{y\\}] \\land R(x,y)]\n\\]\n\nBut by Definition 3.1.1, this assumption is saying exactly that there exists a function \\( Y \\to X \\) that associates to each \\( y \\in Y \\) an element \\( x \\in X \\) such that \\( f(x) = y \\).\n\nTo state this in plainer terms: we tried to prove that there exists a right inverse for \\( f \\) by assuming that there exists a right inverse for \\( f \\). Evidently, this is not a valid proof strategy.\n\nSurprisingly, it turns out that neither the assumption that every surjection has a right inverse, nor the assumption that there exists a surjection with no right inverse, leads to a contradiction. As such, the assertion that every surjection has a right inverse is *provably unprovable*, although the proof that it is unprovable is far beyond the scope of this textbook.\n\nNonetheless, the construction of a right inverse that we gave above didn’t *feel* like we were abusing the fabric of mathematics and logic.\n\nThe essence of the proof is that if a statement of the form \\( \\forall a \\in A, \\exists b \\in B, p(a,b) \\) is true, then we should be able to define a function \\( h : A \\to B \\) such that \\( p(a,h(a)) \\) is true for all \\( a \\in A \\): the function \\( h \\) ‘chooses’ for each \\( a \\in A \\) a particular element \\( b = h(a) \\in B \\) such that \\( p(a,b) \\) is true.\n</markdown>",

For each, find its inverse and prove that it is indeed an inverse.\n\n(a) \\( f : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) defined by \\( f(x) = \\frac{2x+1}{3} \\).\n\n(b) \\( g : \\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N}) \\to \\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N}) \\) defined by \\( g(X) = \\mathbb{N} \\setminus X \\).\n\n(c) \\( h : \\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N} \\) defined by \\( h(m, n) = 2^m(2n+1) - 1 \\) for all \\( m, n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\).\n\nIn light of the correspondences between injections and left inverses, and surjections and right inverses, it may be unsurprising that there is a correspondence between bijections and two-sided inverses.\n\n### Exercise 3.2.40\n\nLet \\( f : X \\to Y \\) be a function. Then \\( f \\) is bijective if and only if \\( f \\) has an inverse.\n\n### Strategy 3.2.41 (Proving a function is bijective by finding an inverse)\n\nIn order to prove that a function \\( f : X \\to Y \\) is bijective, it suffices to find a function \\( g : Y \\to X \\) such that \\( g(f(x)) = x \\) for all \\( x \\in X \\) and \\( f(g(y)) = y \\) for all \\( y \\in Y \\).\n\nWhen proving a function \\( f : X \\to Y \\) is bijective by finding an inverse \\( g : Y \\to X \\), it is important to check that \\( g \\) is both a left inverse and a right inverse for \\( f \\). If you only prove that \\( g \\) is a left inverse for \\( f \\), for example, then you have only proved that \\( f \\) is injective!\n\nIt turns out that if a function has both a left and a right inverse, then they must be equal. This is the content of the following proposition.\n\n### Proposition 3.2.42\n\nLet \\( f : X \\to Y \\) be a function and suppose \\( \\ell : Y \\to X \\) is a left inverse for \\( f \\) and \\( r : Y \\to X \\) is a right inverse for \\( f \\). Then \\( \\ell = r \\).\n\n**Proof**\n\nThe proof is deceptively simple:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\ell &= \\ell \\circ \\text{id}_Y & \\text{by definition of identity functions} \\\\\n&= \\ell \\circ (f \\circ r) & \\text{since } r \\text{ is a right inverse for } f \\\\\n&= (\\ell \\circ f) \\circ r & \\text{by Exercise 3.1.22} \\\\\n&= \\text{id}_X \\circ r & \\text{since } \\ell \\text{ is a left inverse for } f \\\\\n&= r & \\text{by definition of identity functions}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n</markdown>",

        "content": "<markdown>\nThere is some intuition behind why the left and right inverses of a function \\( f : X \\to Y \\) should be equal if they both exist.\n\n- A left inverse \\(\\ell : Y \\to X\\) exists only if \\( f \\) is injective. It looks at each element \\( y \\in Y \\) and, if it is in the image of \\( f \\), returns the (unique) value \\( x \\in X \\) for which \\( f(x) = y \\).\n\n- A right inverse \\( r : Y \\to X \\) exists only if \\( f \\) is surjective. It looks at each element \\( y \\in Y \\) and picks out one of the (possibly many) values \\( x \\in X \\) for which \\( f(x) = y \\).\n\nWhen \\( f \\) is a bijection, every element of \\( Y \\) is in the image of \\( f \\) (by surjectivity), and is a value of \\( f \\) at a unique element of \\( X \\) (by injectivity), and so the left and right inverses are forced to return the same value on each input—hence they are equal.\n\nIt follows from [Proposition 3.2.42](#) that, for any function \\( f : X \\to Y \\), any two inverses for \\( f \\) are equal—that is, every bijective function has a **unique** inverse!\n\n✦ **Notation 3.2.43**  \nLet \\( f : X \\to Y \\) be a function. Write \\( f^{-1} : Y \\to X \\) to denote the (unique) inverse for \\( f \\), if it exists.\n\n✣ **Proposition 3.2.44**  \nLet \\( f : X \\to Y \\) be a bijection. A function \\( g : Y \\to X \\) is a left inverse for \\( f \\) if and only if it is a right inverse for \\( f \\).\n\n**Proof**  \nWe will prove the two directions separately.\n\n- (\\( \\Rightarrow \\)) Suppose \\( g : Y \\to X \\) is a left inverse for \\( f \\)—that is, \\( g(f(x)) = x \\) for all \\( x \\in X \\). We prove that \\( f(g(y)) = y \\) for all \\( y \\in Y \\), thus establishing that \\( g \\) is a right inverse for \\( f \\). So let \\( y \\in Y \\). Since \\( f \\) is a bijection, it is in particular a surjection, so there exists \\( x \\in X \\) such that \\( y = f(x) \\). But then\n  \\[\n  \\begin{align*}\n  f(g(y)) &= f(g(f(x))) & \\text{since } y = f(x) \\\\\n  &= f(x) & \\text{since } g(f(x)) = x \\\\\n  &= y & \\text{since } y = f(x)\n  \\end{align*}\n  \\]\n  So indeed \\( g \\) is a right inverse for \\( f \\).\n\n- (\\( \\Leftarrow \\)) Suppose \\( g : Y \\to X \\) is a right inverse for \\( f \\)—that is, \\( f(g(y)) = y \\) for all \\( y \\in Y \\). We prove that \\( g(f(x)) = x \\) for all \\( x \\in X \\), thus establishing that \\( g \\) is a left inverse for \\( f \\). So let \\( x \\in X \\). Letting \\( y = f(x) \\), we have \\( f(g(y)) = y \\) since \\( g \\) is a right inverse for \\( f \\). This says precisely that \\( f(g(f(x))) = f(x) \\), since \\( y = f(x) \\). By injectivity of \\( f \\), we have \\( g(f(x)) = x \\), as required.\n\n✎ **Exercise 3.2.45**  \nLet \\( f : X \\to Y \\) be a bijection.

Prove that there is a bijection \\( X \\times Y \\to A \\times B \\), and describe its inverse.\n\nAt the beginning of this section we motivated the definitions of injections, surjections and bijections by using them to compare two quantities (of dots and stars)—however, as you might have noticed, we have not yet actually proved that this intuition aligns with reality. For example, how do we know that if there is an injection \\( f : X \\to Y \\) then \\( Y \\) has at least as many elements as \\( X \\)?\n\nAnswering this seemingly simple question is surprisingly difficult and has different answers depending on whether the sets involved are finite or infinite. In fact, the words ‘finite’, ‘infinite’ and ‘size’ are themselves defined in terms of injections, surjections and bijections! We therefore leave this task to future sections.\n\nIn [Section 6.1](#), we define what it means for a set to be finite and what the size of a finite set is ([Definition 6.1.1](#)), and then prove that the sizes of finite sets can be compared by finding an injection, surjection or bijection between them [Theorem 6.1.7](#).\n\nComparing the sizes of infinite sets, and even defining what ‘size’ means for infinite sets, is another can of worms entirely and leads to some fascinating mathematics. For example, we can prove some counterintuitive results, such as the set \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) of natural numbers and the set \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) of rational numbers have the same size. The journey down this rabbit hole begins in [Chapter 10](#).\n</markdown>",

We will not worry about the specifics here—that task is left to Section B.2: a particular notion of natural numbers is defined in Construction B.2.5, and the fact that all notions of natural numbers are ‘essentially the same’ is made precise and proved in Theorem B.2.8.\n\nWe can define all the concepts involving natural numbers that we are familiar with, and prove all the properties that we take for granted, just from the element \\( z \\in \\mathbb{N} \\) and the successor function \\( s : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N} \\).\n\nFor instance, we define ‘0’ to mean \\( z \\), define ‘1’ to mean \\( s(z) \\), define ‘2’ to mean \\( s(s(z)) \\), and so on. Thus ‘12’ is defined to mean\n\n\\[\ns(s(s(s(s(s(s(s(s(s(s(s(z))))))))))))\n\\]\n\nFrom now on, then, let’s write 0 instead of \\( z \\) for the zero element of \\( \\mathbb{N} \\). It would be nice if we could write ‘\\( n + 1 \\)’ instead of \\( s(n) \\), but we must first define what ‘\\(+\\)’ means. In order to do this, we need a way of defining expressions involving natural numbers; this is what the recursion theorem allows us to do.\n\n### Theorem 4.1.2 (Recursion theorem)\nLet \\( X \\) be a set. For all \\( a \\in X \\) and all \\( h : \\mathbb{N} \\times X \\to X \\), there is a unique function \\( f : \\mathbb{N} \\to X \\) such that \\( f(0) = a \\) and \\( f(s(n)) = h(n, f(n)) \\) for all \\( n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\).\n\n**Proof**  \nLet \\( a \\in X \\) and \\( h : \\mathbb{N} \\times X \\to X \\). We prove existence and uniqueness of \\( f \\) separately.\n\n- Define \\( f : \\mathbb{N} \\to X \\) by specifying \\( f(0) = a \\) and \\( f(s(n)) = h(n, f(n)) \\). Since \\( h \\) is a function and \\( s \\) is injective, existence and uniqueness of \\( x \\in X \\) such that \\( f(n) = x \\) is guaranteed, provided that \\( f(n) \\) is defined, so we need only verify totality.\n\nSo let \\( D = \\{ n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid f(n) \\text{ is defined} \\} \\). Then:\n\n- \\( 0 \\in D \\), since \\( f(0) \\) is defined to be equal to \\( a \\).\n- Let \\( n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\) and suppose \\( n \\in D \\). Then \\( f(n) \\) is defined and \\( f(s(n)) = h(n, f(n)) \\), so that \\( f(s(n)) \\) is defined, and hence \\( s(n) \\in D \\).\n\nBy condition (iii) of Definition 4.1.1, we have \\( \\mathbb{N} \\subseteq D \\), so that \\( f(n) \\) is defined for all \\( n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\), as required.\n\n- To see that \\( f \\) is unique, suppose \\( g : \\mathbb{N} \\to X \\) were another function such that \\( g(0) = a \\) and \\( g(s(n)) = h(n, g(n)) \\) for all \\( n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\).\n\nTo see that \\( f = g \\), let \\( E = \\{ n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid f(n) = g(n) \\} \\).

While it is clear in this section that most proofs will be by induction, that will not always be the case, so it is good practice to indicate the proof strategy at hand.\n\n- The base case and induction step are clearly labelled in the proof. This is not strictly necessary from a mathematical perspective, but it helps the reader to navigate the proof and to identify what the goal is at each step.\n\n- We began the induction step by writing, ‘Let \\( n \\geq n_0 \\) and suppose that [… induction hypothesis goes here…]’. This is typically how your induction step should begin, since the proposition being proved in the induction step is of the form \\( \\forall n \\geq n_0, (p(n) \\Rightarrow \\cdots) \\).\n\n- Before proving anything in the base case or induction step, we wrote out what it was that we were trying to prove in that part of the proof. This is helpful because it helps to remind us (and the person reading the proof) what we are aiming to achieve.\n\nLook out for these features in the proof of the next proposition, which is also by induction on \\( n \\geq 0 \\).\n\n### Proposition 4.2.4\nThe natural number \\( n^3 - n \\) is divisible by 3 for all \\( n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\).\n\n**Proof**  \nWe proceed by induction on \\( n \\geq 0 \\).\n\n- **(Base case)** We need to prove that \\( 0^3 - 0 \\) is divisible by 3.

Let \\(X\\) be a set of \\(n+1\\) horses. Removing the first horse from \\(X\\), we see that the last \\(n\\) horses are the same colour by the induction hypothesis. Removing the last horse from \\(X\\), we see that the first \\(n\\) horses are the same colour. Hence all the horses in \\(X\\) are the same colour.\n\nBy induction, we’re done.\n\n### Exercise 4.2.8\n\nWrite down the statement \\(p(n)\\) that Example 4.2.7 attempted to prove for all \\(n \\geq 1\\). Convince yourself that the proof of the base case is correct, then write down—with quantifiers—exactly the proposition that the induction step is meant to prove. Explain why the argument in the induction step failed to prove this proposition.\n\nThere are several ways to avoid situations like that of Example 4.2.7 by simply putting more thought into writing the proof. Some tips are:\n\n- State \\(p(n)\\) explicitly. In the statement ‘all horses are the same colour’ it is not clear exactly what the induction variable is. However, we could have said:\n</markdown>",

Writing out the first few terms in the sequence establishes a pattern that we might attempt to prove:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|cccccccc}\nn & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\\\\n\\hline\na_n & 0 & 1 & 3 & 7 & 15 & 31 & 63 & 127 & 255 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nIt appears that \\( a_n = 2^n - 1 \\) for all \\( n \\geq 0 \\). We prove this by strong induction, taking the cases \\( n = 0 \\) and \\( n = 1 \\) as our base cases.\n\n- **(Base cases)** By definition of the sequence, we have:\n  - \\( a_0 = 0 = 2^0 - 1 \\); and\n  - \\( a_1 = 1 = 2^1 - 1 \\);\n\n  so the claim is true when \\( n = 0 \\) and \\( n = 1 \\).\n\n- **(Induction step)** Fix \\( n \\geq 1 \\) and assume that \\( a_k = 2^k - 1 \\) for all \\( 0 \\leq k \\leq n \\). We need to prove that \\( a_{n+1} = 2^{n+1} - 1 \\).\n\n  Well since \\( n \\geq 1 \\), we have \\( n+1 \\geq 2 \\), so we can apply the recursive formula to \\( a_{n+1} \\). Thus\n\n  \\[\n  \\begin{align*}\n  a_{n+1} &= 3a_n - 2a_{n-1} & \\text{by definition of } a_{n+1} \\\\\n  &= 3(2^n - 1) - 2(2^{n-1} - 1) & \\text{by induction hypothesis} \\\\\n  &= 3 \\cdot 2^n - 3 - 2 \\cdot 2^{n-1} + 2 & \\text{expanding} \\\\\n  &= 3 \\cdot 2^n - 3 - 2^n + 2 & \\text{using laws of indices} \\\\\n  &= 2 \\cdot 2^n - 1 & \\text{simplifying} \\\\\n  &= 2^{n+1} - 1 & \\text{using laws of indices}\n  \\end{align*}\n  \\]\n\nSo the result follows by induction.\n\nThe following exercises have proofs by strong induction with multiple base cases.\n\n### Exercise 4.3.8\n\nDefine a sequence recursively by \\( a_0 = 4, \\, a_1 = 9 \\) and \\( a_n = 5a_{n-1} - 6a_{n-2} \\) for all \\( n \\geq 2 \\).

Strong induction\n\nProve that \\( t_n \\leq 2^{n-3} \\) for all \\( n \\geq 3 \\).\n\n### Exercise 4.3.10\n\nThe Frobenius coin problem asks when a given amount of money can be obtained from coins of given denominations. For example, a value of 7 dubloons cannot be obtained using only 3 dubloon and 5 dubloon coins, but for all \\( n \\geq 8 \\), a value of \\( n \\) dubloons can be obtained using only 3 dubloon and 5 dubloon coins. Prove this.\n\n## Well-ordering principle\n\nThe underlying reason why we can perform induction and recursion on the natural numbers is because of the way they are ordered. Specifically, the natural numbers satisfy the **well-ordering principle**: if a set of natural numbers has at least one element, then it has a least element. This sets the natural numbers apart from the other number sets; for example, \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) has no least element, since if \\( a \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\) then \\( a - 1 \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\) and \\( a - 1 < a \\).\n\n### Theorem 4.3.11 (Well-ordering principle)\n\nLet \\( X \\) be a set of natural numbers. If \\( X \\) is inhabited, then \\( X \\) has a least element.\n\n**Idea of proof**\n\nUnder the assumption that \\( X \\) is a set of natural numbers, the proposition we want to prove has the form \\( p \\Rightarrow q \\). Namely\n\n\\[ \nX \\text{ is inhabited } \\Rightarrow X \\text{ has a least element} \n\\]\n\nAssuming \\( X \\) is inhabited doesn’t really give us much to work with, so let’s try the contrapositive:\n\n\\[ \nX \\text{ has no least element } \\Rightarrow X \\text{ is empty} \n\\]\n\nThe assumption that \\( X \\) has no least element *does* give us something to work with. Under this assumption we need to deduce that \\( X \\) is empty.\n\nWe will do this by ‘forcing \\( X \\) up’ by strong induction. Certainly \\( 0 \\notin X \\), otherwise it would be the least element. If none of the numbers \\( 0, 1, \\ldots, n \\) are elements of \\( X \\) then neither can \\( n + 1 \\) be, since if it were then it would be the least element of \\( X \\). Let’s make this argument formal.\n\n**Proof**\n\nLet \\( X \\) be a set of natural numbers containing no least element. We prove by strong induction that \\( n \\notin X \\) for all \\( n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\).\n\n- **(Base case)** \\( 0 \\notin X \\) since if \\( 0 \\in X \\) then 0 must be the least element of \\( X \\), as it is the least natural number.\n</markdown>",

Since \\( X \\) is a set of natural numbers, and it contains no natural numbers, it follows that \\( X \\) is empty.\n\nThe following proof that \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) is irrational is a classic application of the well-ordering principle.\n\n✣ **Proposition 4.3.12**  \nThe number \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) is irrational.\n\nTo prove **Proposition 4.3.12** we will use the following lemma, which uses the well-ordering principle to prove that fractions can be ‘cancelled to lowest terms’.\n\n✣ **Lemma 4.3.13**  \nLet \\( q \\) be a positive rational number. There is a pair of nonzero natural numbers \\( a, b \\) such that \\( q = \\frac{a}{b} \\) and such that the only natural number which divides both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is 1.\n\n*Proof*  \nFirst note that we can express \\( q \\) as the ratio of two nonzero natural numbers, since \\( q \\) is a positive rational number. By the well-ordering principle, there is a *least* natural number \\( a \\) such that \\( q = \\frac{a}{b} \\) for some positive \\( b \\in \\mathbb{N} \\).\n\nSuppose that some natural number \\( d \\) other than 1 divides both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Note that \\( d \\neq 0 \\), since if \\( d = 0 \\) then that would imply \\( a = 0 \\). Since \\( d \\neq 1 \\), it follows that \\( d \\geq 2 \\).\n\nSince \\( d \\) divides \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), there exist natural numbers \\( a', b' \\) such that \\( a = a'd \\) and \\( b = b'd \\). Moreover, \\( a', b' > 0 \\) since \\( a, b, d > 0 \\). It follows that\n\n\\[\nq = \\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{a'd}{b'd} = \\frac{a'}{b'}\n\\]\n\nBut \\( d \\geq 2 \\), and hence\n\n\\[\na' = \\frac{a}{d} \\leq \\frac{a}{2} < a\n\\]\n\ncontradicting minimality of \\( a \\). Hence our assumption that some natural number \\( d \\) other than 1 divides both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) was false—it follows that the only natural number dividing both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is 1.\n\nWe are now ready to prove that \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) is irrational.\n\n*Proof of Proposition 4.3.12*  \nSuppose \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) is rational.

We can make this idea of ‘interaction’ precise using the notion of a **relation**.\n\n✦ **Definition 5.1.1**  \nLet \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) be sets. A (binary) relation from \\( X \\) to \\( Y \\) is a logical formula \\( R(x, y) \\) with two free variables \\( x \\in X \\) and \\( y \\in Y \\). We call \\( X \\) the **domain** of \\( R \\) and \\( Y \\) the **codomain** of \\( R \\).\n\nA relation \\( R \\) is **homogeneous** if it has the same domain and codomain \\( X \\), in which case we say that \\( R \\) is a relation on \\( X \\).\n\nGiven \\( x \\in X \\) and \\( y \\in Y \\), if \\( R(x, y) \\) is true then we say ‘\\( x \\) is related to \\( y \\) by \\( R \\)’, and write \\( x R y \\) (\\(\\LaTeX\\) code: \\( x \\mathrel{R} y \\)).\n\n✐ **Example 5.1.2**  \nWe have already seen many examples of relations.\n\n- Divisibility (‘\\( x \\) divides \\( y \\)’) is a relation on \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\).\n- The inequality relation \\(\\leq\\) is a relation on \\( \\mathbb{R} \\).\n- For any set \\( X \\), equality \\( = \\) is a relation on \\( X \\).\n- Logical equivalence \\(\\equiv\\) is a relation on the set of all logical formulae.\n- For any set \\( X \\), the subset relation \\(\\subseteq\\) is a relation on \\(\\mathcal{P}(X)\\).\n\nThese relations were all homogeneous, but not all relations are:\n\n- For any set \\( X \\), the elementhood relation \\(\\in\\) is a relation from \\( X \\) to \\(\\mathcal{P}(X)\\).\n- Every function \\( f : X \\to Y \\) induces a relation \\( R_f \\) from \\( X \\) to \\( Y \\), defined by taking \\( x R_f y \\) to mean \\( f(x) = y \\).\n\n✐ **Exercise 5.1.3**  \nGive three more examples of relations, not all of which are homogeneous.\n</markdown>",

        "content": "<markdown>\nLike with sets and functions, we must determine when to declare that two relations are equal. For example, consider the relation \\( R \\) on \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) defined for \\( a, b \\in \\mathbb{R} \\) by letting \\( a \\, R \\, b \\) mean \\(\\exists x \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\, a + x^2 = b\\). It so happens that \\( a \\, R \\, b \\) if and only if \\( a \\leq b \\)—we’ll prove this in Example 5.1.5. So should \\( R \\) be equal to \\(\\leq\\)? On the one hand you might say ‘yes’, since \\(\\leq\\) and \\( R \\) relate the same pairs of real numbers. On the other hand you might say ‘no’, since the fact that \\(\\leq\\) and \\( R \\) relate the same pairs of real numbers was not immediate and required proof. In fact, if we were to replace \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) by \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), it then \\(\\leq\\) and \\( R \\) would not relate the same pairs of elements, since for instance \\( 0 \\leq 2 \\) but there is no rational number \\( x \\) such that \\( 0 + x^2 = 2 \\).\n\nBut as with sets and functions, we settle for the extensional notion of equality: just as two sets are equal when they have the same elements (Axiom 2.1.22), and two functions are equal when they have the same values (Axiom 3.1.4), we consider two relations to be equal when they relate the same pairs of elements (Axiom 5.1.4).\n\n### Axiom 5.1.4 (Relation extensionality)\nLet \\( R \\) and \\( S \\) be relations. Then \\( R = S \\) if and only if \\( R \\) and \\( S \\) have the same domain \\( X \\) and codomain \\( Y \\), and\n\n\\[\n\\forall x \\in X, \\, \\forall y \\in Y, \\, (x \\, R \\, y \\iff x \\, S \\, y)\n\\]\n\nThat is, two relations with the same domain and codomain are equal precisely when they relate the same pairs of elements.\n\n### Example 5.1.5\nRecall the relation \\( R \\) on \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) that we defined above for \\( a, b \\in \\mathbb{R} \\) by letting \\( a \\, R \\, b \\) if and only if \\( a + x^2 = b \\) for some \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\). To see that \\( R = \\leq \\), note that \\( a + (b - a) = b \\), and that \\( b - a \\) is the square of a real number if and only if \\( b - a \\geq 0 \\), which occurs if and only if \\( a \\leq b \\).\n\n### Exercise 5.1.6\nLet \\( R \\) and \\( S \\) be relations on \\( \\mathbb{R} \\) defined for \\( a, b \\in \\mathbb{R} \\) by letting\n\n\\[\na \\, R \\, b \\iff b - a \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad a \\, S \\, b \\iff \\exists n \\in \\mathbb{Z}, \\, (n \\neq 0) \\land n(b - a) \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n\\]\n\nProve that \\( R = S \\).\n\nThe true reason why Axiom 5.1.4 is powerful is that it allows us to reason about relations entirely set theoretically by working with their graphs—the sets of pairs of elements that they relate—rather than with the particular formulae defining the relation.\n\n### Definition 5.1.7\nLet \\( R \\) be a relation from a set \\( X \\) to a set \\( Y \\). The **graph** of \\( R \\) is the set \\(\\mathrm{Gr}(R)\\) of pairs \\((x, y) \\in X \\times Y\\) for which \\( x \\, R \\, y \\).

Furthermore, in order to prove that two relations \\( R \\) and \\( S \\) are equal, it suffices to prove that they have the same domain and codomain, and that their graphs are equal.\n\n### Example 5.1.16\n\nConsider the set \\( G = \\{(2m+i, 2n+i) \\mid m, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}, i \\in \\{0, 1\\}\\} \\).

In fact, they broadly fall into one of two categories: **equivalence relations**, which are relations that ‘behave like \\( = \\)’; and **order relations**, which are relations that ‘behave like \\( < \\)’. We will study equivalence relations in Section 5.2 and order relations in Section 12.1, but examples of such relations pop up throughout the book. (In fact, we have already seen several!)\n\nOur task for the rest of this section is to isolate the properties that a relation must satisfy in order to be classified as an equivalence relation or an order relation.\n\nTo aid with intuition, we will illustrate these properties with diagrams: given a relation \\( R \\), the fact that \\( a \\, R \\, b \\) will be represented diagrammatically as follows:\n\n\\[\na \\longrightarrow b\n\\]\n</markdown>",

Note that \\( a - a = 0 \\), which is divisible by \\( n \\) since \\( 0 = 0 \\times n \\), and hence \\( a \\equiv a \\mod n \\). So congruence modulo \\( n \\) is reflexive.\n\n(b) Let \\( a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\) and suppose \\( a \\equiv b \\mod n \\).

So congruence modulo \\( n \\) is symmetric.\n\n(c) Let \\( a, b, c \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\) and suppose that \\( a \\equiv b \\mod n \\) and \\( b \\equiv c \\mod n \\).

Hence \\( a \\equiv c \\mod n \\), as required. So congruence modulo \\( n \\) is transitive.\n\nSince congruence modulo \\( n \\) is reflexive, symmetric and transitive, it is an equivalence relation.\n\n### Equivalence classes\n\nWhat makes equivalence relations so useful is they give us a way of ignoring information that is irrelevant to the task at hand.\n\nFor example, suppose \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are two very large natural numbers, each with several trillion (decimal) digits. We want to know what the last digit of \\( ab \\) is. To find this out, it would be silly to compute \\( ab \\) and then look at its last digit. Instead, we can observe that the last digit of a product of two integers depends only on the last digit of each integer—for example, \\( 1527 \\times 9502 \\) has the same last digit as \\( 7 \\times 2 = 14 \\). By using the equivalence relation ‘has the same last digit as’, we are able to ignore the irrelevant information about \\( a \\) and \\( b \\)—that is, all but one of their trillions of digits—and simplify the problem considerably.\n</markdown>",

The set \\([n]\\) is defined by \\([n] = \\{ k \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid 1 \\leq k \\leq n \\}\\).\n\nSince ‘pairing up’ really means ‘finding a bijection’, we are now ready to define what it means for a set to be finite.\n\n### Definition 6.1.1\nA set \\( X \\) is **finite** if there exists a bijection \\( f : [n] \\to X \\) for some \\( n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\). The function \\( f \\) is called an **enumeration** of \\( X \\). If \\( X \\) is not finite we say it is **infinite**.\n\nThis definition suggests the following strategy for proving that a set is finite.\n\n### Strategy 6.1.2 (Proving that a set is finite)\nIn order to prove that a set \\( X \\) is finite, it suffices to find a bijection \\([n] \\to X\\) for some \\( n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\).\n\n### Example 6.1.3\nLet \\( X = \\{ \\text{red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple} \\} \\).

Define \\( f : [6] \\to X \\) by\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nf(1) &= \\text{red} \\\\\nf(2) &= \\text{orange} \\\\\nf(3) &= \\text{yellow} \\\\\nf(4) &= \\text{green} \\\\\nf(5) &= \\text{blue} \\\\\nf(6) &= \\text{purple}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThe function \\( f \\) is evidently a bijection, since each element of \\( X \\) can be expressed uniquely as \\( f(k) \\) for some \\( k \\in [6] \\). So \\( X \\) is finite.\n\n### Exercise 6.1.4\nProve that \\([n]\\) is finite for each \\( n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\).\n\nNote that Exercise 6.1.4 implies, in particular, that \\(\\emptyset\\) is finite, since \\(\\emptyset = [0]\\).\n\n## The size of a finite set\n\nWhilst it might sometimes be useful just to know that a set is finite, it will be even more useful to know how many elements it has. This quantity is called the **size** of the set. Intuitively, the size of the set should be the length of the list of its elements, but for this to be well-defined, we first need to know that the number of elements in the list is independent of the way we choose to list them.\n\nThe ‘list of elements’ of a finite set \\( X \\) is the bijection \\([n] \\to X\\) given by Definition 6.1.1, and \\( n \\) is the length of the list, this means that we need to prove that if \\([m] \\to X\\) and \\([n] \\to X\\) are bijections, then \\( m = n \\).

Then there is an injection \\( f^v : X \\setminus \\{a\\} \\to Y \\setminus \\{f(a)\\} \\) defined by \\( f^v(x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\in X \\setminus \\{a\\} \\). Moreover if \\( f \\) is a bijection \\( X \\to Y \\), then \\( f^v \\) is a bijection \\( X \\setminus \\{a\\} \\to Y \\setminus \\{f(a)\\} \\).\n\n**Proof**  \nNote that \\( f^v \\) is well-defined by injectivity of \\( f \\): indeed, if we had \\( f(x) = f(a) \\) for some \\( x \\in X \\setminus \\{a\\} \\), then that would imply \\( x = a \\in X \\setminus \\{a\\} \\), which is a contradiction.\n\nTo see that \\( f^v \\) is injective, let \\( x, y \\in X \\setminus \\{a\\} \\) and \\( f^v(x) = f^v(y) \\). Then \\( f(x) = f(y) \\), so that \\( x = y \\) by injectivity of \\( f \\).\n\nNow suppose that \\( f \\) is a bijection. Then \\( f \\) has an inverse \\( g : Y \\to X \\), which is itself a bijection (and hence an injection). Repeating the above argument with \\( g \\) yields an injection \\( g^v : Y \\setminus \\{f(a)\\} \\to X \\setminus \\{a\\} \\) defined by \\( g^v(y) = g(y) \\) for all \\( y \\in Y \\).

Hence if \\( f \\) is a bijection, then \\( f^v \\) is a bijection.\n\nA consequence of Lemma 6.1.5 is the next useful result, which we will use in our proof that every set has a unique ‘size’.\n\n### Lemma 6.1.6\nLet \\( X \\) be an inhabited set. There is a bijection \\( X \\setminus \\{a\\} \\to X \\setminus \\{b\\} \\) for all \\( a, b \\in X \\).\n\n**Proof**  \nDefine \\( f : X \\to X \\) be the function that swaps \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) and leaves all other elements of \\( X \\) fixed—that is, we define\n\n\\[\nf(x) = \n\\begin{cases} \nb & \\text{if } x = a \\\\ \na & \\text{if } x = b \\\\ \nx & \\text{if } x \\notin \\{a, b\\} \n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nNote that \\( f(f(x)) = x \\) for all \\( x \\in X \\), so \\( f \\) is a bijection—it is its own inverse! Since \\( f(a) = b \\), it follows from Lemma 6.1.5 that the function \\( f^v : X \\setminus \\{a\\} \\to X \\setminus \\{b\\} \\) defined by \\( f^v(x) = f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\in X \\setminus \\{a\\} \\) is a bijection, as required.\n</markdown>",

Then \\( m = n \\).\n\n**Proof**\n\nSince \\( f : [m] \\to X \\) and \\( g : [n] \\to X \\) are bijections, the function \\( g^{-1} \\circ f : [m] \\to [n] \\) is a bijection by Exercises 3.2.20 and 3.2.45.

        "content": "<markdown>\n## Section 6.2\n\n# Countable and uncountable sets\n\nIn [Section 6.1](#), we defined what it means for a set to be ‘finite’ in order to capture the idea that its elements can be listed in such a way that the list has a start and an end. We did so by observing that a list of the elements of a finite set is essentially the same thing as a bijection \\( f : [n] \\to X \\) for some \\( n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\), with the element \\( f(k) \\in X \\) playing the role of the \\( k \\)th element of the list.\n\nWe are now interested in **infinite sets**. We certainly can’t expect a list of all the elements of an infinite set to end, so the question now is: can its elements be listed if we allow the list to be infinite? We will call such sets **countable sets**.\n\nIt is perhaps surprising that not every set is countable: some sets are ‘too big’ for their elements to be listed! We will prove that such **uncountable sets** exist later in this section.\n\nThe precise definition of what it means for a set \\( X \\) to be countable ([Definition 6.2.1](#)) captures the idea that we can list the elements of \\( X \\) one-by-one such that, even if the list goes on forever, each element of \\( X \\) appears at some finite stage in the list. The list might or might not be finite; it has a start, but it might not have an end.\n\nTo illustrate, consider the following list of the elements of \\( \\mathbb{N} \\):\n\n\\[ 0, \\ 1, \\ 2, \\ 3, \\ 4, \\ \\ldots, \\ n, \\ n+1, \\ \\ldots \\]\n\nThe list does not end, since \\( \\mathbb{N} \\) is infinite ([Theorem 6.1.25](#)), but nevertheless every natural number appears at some finite stage along the list.\n\nAs another example, consider the set \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) of all integers. We might wish to list the elements of \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) in the usual way:\n\n\\[ \\ldots, \\ -(n+1), \\ -n, \\ \\ldots, \\ -3, \\ -2, \\ -1, \\ 0, \\ 1, \\ 2, \\ 3, \\ \\ldots, \\ n, \\ n+1, \\ \\ldots \\]\n\nThis does not fulfil our criterion that the list must have a start: it is infinite in both directions. However, it is still possible to list them, by slotting the negative integers in-between the non-negative integers:\n\n\\[ 0, \\ -1, \\ 1, \\ -2, \\ 2, \\ -3, \\ 3, \\ \\ldots, \\ -n, \\ n, \\ -(n+1), \\ n+1, \\ \\ldots \\]\n\nThis is not how we would usually think about listing the integers, but we have nonetheless found a way of doing it so that every integer appears at some finite stage on the list.\n\nBut specifying a list of the elements of an infinite set \\( X \\), such that every element of \\( X \\) appears at some finite stage on the list, is equivalent to specifying a bijection \\( f : \\mathbb{N} \\to X \\).\n</markdown>",

Keep in mind, though, that formally the elements of this string are **words** and not **numbers**, and that two words may correspond with the same natural number—for example 123 and 00123 are distinct elements of \\(\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}^*\\), despite the fact that they both **represent** the same natural number.\n\n### Exercise 6.2.28\n\nLet \\(\\Sigma = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, \\div, -\\}\\).

As we have already mentioned, it is not always the case that one integer can divide another. As you read through this section, note that we never use fractions; everything we do is internal to \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), and does not require that we ‘spill over’ to \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) at any point. This will help you when you study ring theory in the future, and is a good practice to mimic in your own work.\n\nThe following theorem, called the division theorem, is the crux of everything that is to follow.\n\n### Theorem 7.1.1 (Division theorem)\nLet \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) with \\(b \\neq 0\\). There exist unique \\(q, r \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) such that\n\n\\[ \na = qb + r \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 0 \\leq r < |b| \n\\]\n\n### Strategy\nLet’s look at the simple case when \\(a \\geq 0\\) and \\(b > 0\\). We can always find \\(q, r\\) such that \\(a = qb + r\\), for example \\(q = 0\\) and \\(r = a\\). Moreover, by increasing \\(q\\) we can reduce \\(r\\), since\n\n\\[ \nqb + r = (q + 1)b + (r - b) \n\\]\n\nWe will keep doing this until the ‘remainder’ is as small as it can be without being negative. As an example, consider the case when \\(a = 14\\) and \\(b = 5\\). This procedure gives\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n14 &= 0 \\times 5 + 14 \\\\\n   &= 1 \\times 5 + 9 \\\\\n   &= 2 \\times 5 + 4 \\quad \\leftarrow \\text{least nonnegative remainder} \\\\\n   &= 3 \\times 5 + (-1) \\\\\n   &= \\ldots\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThis procedure shows that in this case we should take \\(q = 2\\) and \\(r = 4\\), since \\(14 = 2 \\times 5 + 4\\) and \\(0 \\leq 4 < |5|\\).\n\nWe can show that such a descending sequence of remainders terminates using the well-ordering principle, and then we must argue that the quotient and remainder that we obtain are unique.\n\n### Proof\nWe may assume that \\(b > 0\\): if not, replace \\(b\\) by \\(-b\\) and \\(q\\) by \\(-q\\). We may also assume that \\(a \\geq 0\\). Otherwise, replace \\(a\\) by \\(-a\\), \\(q\\) by \\(-(q + 1)\\) and \\(r\\) by \\(b - r\\).\n</markdown>",

Namely, we define a sequence \\( (r_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\) such that \\( a = nb + r_n \\) and \\( r_0 > r_1 > r_2 > \\cdots \\), and use this sequence to find the values of \\( q, r \\).\n\n  - Let \\( r_0 = a \\).

Then\n\n    \\[\n    (n+1)b + r_{n+1} = (n+1)b + r_n - b = nb + b + r_n - b = nb + r = a\n    \\]\n\n    Since \\( b > 0 \\), we must have \\( r_{n+1} < r_n \\) for all \\( n \\).\n\nLet \\( R = \\bigcap \\{ r_n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\} \\). That is, \\( R \\) is the set of terms of the sequence which are non-negative. Since \\( r_0 = a \\geq 0 \\), we have that \\( r_0 \\in R \\) and hence \\( R \\) is inhabited. By the well-ordering principle, \\( R \\) has a least element \\( r_k \\) for some \\( k \\in \\mathbb{N} \\).\n\nDefine \\( q = k \\) and \\( r = r_k \\). By construction we have \\( a = qb + r \\) and \\( r \\geq 0 \\), so it remains to show that \\( r < b \\). Well, if \\( r \\geq b \\) then \\( r - b \\geq 0 \\), but \\( r - b = r_{k+1} \\), so this would imply \\( r_{k+1} \\in R \\), contradicting minimality of \\( r \\). Hence \\( r < b \\), so \\( q, r \\) are as required.\n\n- **Uniqueness.** Suppose \\( q', r' \\) also satisfy \\( a = q'b + r' \\) and \\( 0 \\leq r' < b \\). If we can show that \\( r' = r \\) then this proves that \\( q = q' \\): indeed, if \\( qb + r = q'b + r \\) then we can subtract \\( r \\) and then divide by \\( b \\), since \\( b > 0 \\).\n\nFirst note that \\( q' \\geq 0 \\). If \\( q' < 0 \\) then \\( q' \\leq -1 \\), so\n\n\\[\na = q'b + r' \\leq -b + r'\n\\]\n\nand hence \\( r' \\geq a + b \\geq b \\) since \\( a \\geq 0 \\). This contradicts the assumption that \\( r < b \\). So \\( q' \\geq 0 \\).\n\nSince \\( q' \\geq 0 \\), we also know that \\( a = q'b + r' \\), and hence \\( r' = r_{q'} \\in R \\). By minimality of \\( r \\) we have \\( r \\leq r' \\). It remains to show that \\( r = r' \\). If not then \\( r < r' \\). Thus\n\n\\[\nqb + r = q'b + r' > q'b + r \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad qb > q'b \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad q > q'\n\\]\n\nand hence \\( q = q' + t \\) for some \\( t \\geq 1 \\). But then\n\n\\[\nq'b + r' = a = qb + r = (q' + t)b + r = q'b + (tb + r)\n\\]\n\nso \\( r' = tb + r \\geq b \\), contradicting \\( r' < b \\).

But as always, we will make these terms precise when we need to.\n\n### Primes and irreducibles\n\nThere are two ways that we might want to characterise the so-called atomic integer that we just mentioned.\n\n- One way that an integer might be atomic is if it allows us to break down products of integers—this leads to the notion of *prime* (Definition 7.2.1).\n- Another way is that an integer might be atomic is if it cannot be split up as a product of more than one integer (in a nontrivial way)—this leads to the notion of *irreducible* (Definition 7.2.6).\n\nConveniently, as we will show in Theorem 7.2.11, these two notions coincide. But the fact that they coincide is not obvious, and uses essential properties of the integers that do not hold in more general structures.\n\nThe definition of *prime* that we are about to give comes from abstract algebra (specifically, from ring theory). It might seem strange, but we will soon be able to show that the more familiar definition—that is, having exactly two positive divisors—is equivalent to this one.\n\n✦ **Definition 7.2.1**  \nAn integer \\( p \\) is (ring theoretically) *prime* if \\( p \\) is a nonzero nonunit and, for all \\( a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\), if \\( p \\mid ab \\) then \\( p \\mid a \\) or \\( p \\mid b \\).\n</markdown>",

        "A": " A: Since \\( p \\) is prime and divides \\( ab \\), it must divide at least one of \\( a \\) or \\( b \\). In this case, since \\( p \\) does not divide \\( 3 \\) or \\( 5 \\) (the primes themselves), the conclusion is that \\( p \\) must be a divisor of a product that equals \\( 15 \\), but it cannot divide either \\( 3 \\) or \\( 5 \\).

Then there exist \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) such that \\(2 \\mid ab\\) but 2 divides neither \\(a\\) nor \\(b\\). Thus \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both odd, meaning that \\(ab\\) is odd... but this contradicts the assumption that \\(2 \\mid ab\\).\n\nHowever, 18 is not prime. Indeed, \\(18 \\mid 12 \\times 15\\) but 18 divides neither 12 nor 15.\n\n### Exercise 7.2.3\n\nUsing Definition 7.2.1, prove that 3 and 5 are prime, and that 4 is not prime.\n\n### Example 7.2.4\n\nLet \\(k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) with \\(0 < k < 5\\). We’ll show that \\(5 \\mid \\binom{5}{k}\\).\n\nWell, by Theorem 4.2.14 we know that\n\n\\[\n5! = \\binom{5}{k} k! (5-k)!\n\\]\n\nBy Definition 4.1.14, we have\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 4! = \\binom{5}{k} \\times \\underbrace{1 \\times \\cdots \\times k}_{=k!} \\times \\underbrace{1 \\times \\cdots \\times (5-k)}_{=(5-k)!}\n\\]\n\nSince 5 is prime, it must divide one of the factors on the right-hand side of this equation. Thus, either 5 divides \\(\\binom{5}{k}\\), or it divides \\(\\ell\\) for some \\(1 \\leq \\ell \\leq k\\) or \\(1 \\leq \\ell \\leq 5-k\\). But \\(k < 5\\) and \\(5-k < 5\\), so it cannot divide any of these values of \\(\\ell\\)—if it did, it would imply \\(5 \\leq \\ell \\leq k\\) or \\(5 \\leq \\ell \\leq 5-k\\), which is nonsense. Hence 5 must divide \\(\\binom{5}{k}\\).\n\n### Exercise 7.2.5\n\nLet \\(p \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) be a positive prime and let \\(0 < k < p\\). Show that \\(p \\mid \\binom{p}{k}\\).\n\nWe now arrive at our second notion of atomic, capturing the idea that it should not be possible to break an atomic integer into smaller parts.\n\n### Definition 7.2.6\n\nAn integer \\(a\\) is **irreducible** if \\(a\\) is a nonzero nonunit and, for all \\(m, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), if \\(a = mn\\), then either \\(m\\) or \\(n\\) is a unit. Otherwise, \\(a\\) is **reducible**.\n\nThe notion of irreducible captures more closely the more familiar notion of ‘prime’, as the next result shows.\n\n### Proposition 7.2.7\n\nLet \\(p \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) be a nonzero nonunit. Then \\(p\\) is irreducible if and only if the only divisors of \\(p\\) are \\(p\\), \\(-p\\), 1 and \\(-1\\).\n</markdown>",

Let \\(P\\) be the set of all positive prime numbers. Then \\(P\\) is inhabited, since \\(2 \\in P\\), for example. If \\(P\\) were finite, then by Exercise 7.2.21, there would be a positive prime which is not an element of \\(P\\)—but \\(P\\) contains all positive primes, so that is impossible. Hence there are infinitely many positive primes.\n\nThis is one proof of many and is attributed to Euclid, who lived around 2300 years ago.

Specifically:\n\n- In [Theorem 5.2.11](#) we proved that congruence is an equivalence relation.

Prove that, for all \\( k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\), \\( u + kn \\) is a multiplicative inverse for \\( a \\) modulo \\( n \\).\n\n### Proposition 7.3.14\nLet \\( a \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\) and let \\( n \\) be a modulus. Then \\( a \\) has a multiplicative inverse modulo \\( n \\) if and only if \\( a \\perp n \\).\n\n**Proof**  \nNote that \\( a \\) has a multiplicative inverse \\( u \\) modulo \\( n \\) if and only if there is a solution \\( (u, v) \\) to the equation \\( au + nv = 1 \\). Indeed, \\( au \\equiv 1 \\mod n \\) if and only if \\( n \\mid au - 1 \\), which occurs if and only if there is some \\( q \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\) such that \\( au - 1 = nq \\). Setting \\( q = -v \\) and rearranging yields the desired equivalence.\n\nBy Bézout’s lemma (Theorem 7.1.23), such a solution \\( (u, v) \\) exists if and only if \\( \\gcd(a, n) \\mid 1 \\). This occurs if and only if \\( \\gcd(a, n) = 1 \\), i.e. if and only if \\( a \\perp n \\).\n\n**Proof tip**  \nTo solve a congruence of the form \\( ax \\equiv b \\mod n \\) when \\( a \\perp n \\), first find a multiplicative inverse \\( u \\) for \\( a \\) modulo \\( n \\), and then simply multiply through by \\( u \\) to obtain \\( x \\equiv ub \\mod n \\).\n\n### Corollary 7.3.15\nLet \\( a, p \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\), where \\( p \\) is a positive prime. If \\( p \\nmid a \\) then \\( a \\) has a multiplicative inverse modulo \\( p \\).\n\n**Proof**  \nSuppose \\( p \\nmid a \\), and let \\( d = \\gcd(a, p) \\). Since \\( d \\mid p \\) and \\( p \\) is prime we have \\( d = 1 \\) or \\( d = p \\). Since \\( d \\mid a \\) and \\( p \\nmid a \\) we can’t have \\( d = p \\); therefore \\( d = 1 \\). By Proposition 7.3.14, \\( a \\) has a multiplicative inverse modulo \\( p \\).\n\n### Example 7.3.16\n11 is prime, so each of the integers \\( a \\) with \\( 1 \\leq a \\leq 10 \\) should have a multiplicative inverse modulo 11.

We don’t do this because, although this is an interesting result, it is not particularly useful in applications. We might even hope that Wilson’s theorem gives us an easy way to test whether a number is prime, but unfortunately even this is a bust: computing the remainder \\( (n-1)! \\) on division by \\( n \\) is not particularly efficient.\n\nHowever, there are some nice applications of Wilson’s theorem, which we will explore now.\n\n✦ **Example 7.3.40**\n\nWe’ll compute the remainder of \\( 3^{45} \\cdot 44! \\) when divided by 47. Note that \\( 3^{45} \\cdot 44! \\) is equal to a monstrous number with 76 digits; I don’t recommend doing the long division! Anyway…\n\n- 47 is prime, so we can apply both Fermat’s little theorem (Theorem 7.3.22) and Wilson’s theorem (Theorem 7.3.36).\n\n- By Fermat’s little theorem, we know that \\( 3^{46} \\equiv 1 \\mod 47 \\). Since \\( 3 \\cdot 16 = 48 \\equiv 1 \\mod 47 \\), we have\n\n  \\[\n  3^{45} \\equiv 3^{45} \\cdot (3 \\cdot 16) \\equiv 3^{46} \\cdot 16 \\equiv 16 \\mod 47\n  \\]\n\n- By Wilson’s theorem, we have \\( 46! \\equiv -1 \\mod 47 \\). Now\n  - \\( 46 \\equiv -1 \\mod 47 \\), so 46 is its own multiplicative inverse modulo 47.\n  - The extended Euclidean algorithm yields \\( 45 \\cdot 23 \\equiv 1 \\mod 47 \\).\n\n  So we have\n\n  \\[\n  44! = 44! \\cdot (45 \\cdot 23) \\cdot (46 \\cdot 46) \\equiv 46! \\cdot 23 \\cdot 46 \\equiv (-1) \\cdot 23 \\cdot (-1) \\equiv 23 \\mod 47\n  \\]\n\nPutting this information together yields\n\n\\[\n3^{45} \\cdot 44! \\equiv 16 \\cdot 23 = 368 \\equiv 39 \\mod 47\n\\]\n\nSo the remainder left when \\( 3^{45} \\cdot 44! \\) is divided by 47 is 39.\n</markdown>",

As the recipient of the message, Bob has a public key and a private key. So:\n\n- Bob sends the **public key** to Alice.\n- Alice uses the public key to encrypt the message.\n- Alice sends the encrypted message, which is visible (but encrypted) to anyone who intercepts it.\n- Bob keeps the private key secret, and uses it upon receipt of the message to decrypt the message.\n\nNotice that, since the public key can only be used to **encrypt** messages, a hacker has no useful information upon intercepting the message or the public key.\n\n**RSA encryption** is an algorithm which provides one means of doing public-key cryptography using the theory of modular arithmetic. It works as follows.\n\n**Step 1.** Let \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) be distinct positive prime numbers, and let \\( n = pq \\). Then \\( \\varphi(n) = (p-1)(q-1) \\).\n\n**Step 2.** Choose \\( e \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\) such that \\( 1 < e < \\varphi(n) \\) and \\( e \\perp \\varphi(n) \\).

The pair \\( (n, d) \\) is called the **private key**.\n\n**Step 4.** To encrypt a message \\( M \\) (which is encoded as an integer), compute \\( K \\in [n] \\) such that \\( K \\equiv M^e \\mod n \\). Then \\( K \\) is the encrypted message.\n\n**Step 5.** The original message \\( M \\) can be recovered since \\( M \\equiv K^d \\mod n \\).\n\nComputing the private key \\( (n, d) \\) from the knowledge of \\( (n, e) \\) would allow a hacker to decrypt an encrypted message.

Now Alice can encrypt the message:\n  \\[\n  32^7 \\equiv 59 \\mod 221\n  \\]\n  Alice then sends Bob the encrypted message 59.\n\n- The private key is \\( (221, 55) \\), so Bob can decrypt the message:\n  \\[\n  59^{55} \\equiv 32 \\mod 221\n  \\]\n  so Bob has received Alice’s message 32.\n\n**Exercise 7.3.57**  \nProve that the RSA algorithm is correct.

This process is called *counting* and is at the core of the mathematical field of combinatorics.\n\n### Binomials and factorials revisited\n\nWe defined binomial coefficients \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) and factorials \\(n!\\) recursively in [Chapter 4](#), and proved elementary facts about them by induction. We will now re-define them combinatorially—that is, we give them meaning in terms of sizes of particular finite sets. We will prove that the combinatorial and recursive definitions are equivalent, and prove facts about them using combinatorial arguments.\n\nThe reasons for doing so are manifold. The combinatorial definitions allow us to reason about binomials and factorials with direct reference to descriptions of finite sets, which will be particularly useful when we prove identities about them using *double counting*. Moreover, the combinatorial definitions remove the seemingly arbitrary nature of the recursive definitions—for example, they provide a reason why it makes sense to define \\(0! = 1\\) and \\(\\binom{0}{0} = 1\\).\n\n✦ **Definition 8.1.1**  \nLet \\(X\\) be a set and let \\(k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). A *k-element subset* of \\(X\\) is a subset \\(U \\subseteq X\\) such that \\(|U| = k\\). The set of all k-element subsets of \\(X\\) is denoted \\(\\binom{X}{k}\\) (read: ‘X choose k’) ([LaTeX code: \\texttt{\\textbackslash binom\\{X\\}\\{k\\}}]).\n\nIntuitively, \\(\\binom{X}{k}\\) is the set of ways of picking \\(k\\) elements from \\(X\\), without repetitions, in such a way that order doesn’t matter. (If order mattered, the elements would be *sequences* instead of subsets.)\n\n✐ **Example 8.1.2**  \nWe find \\(\\binom{[4]}{k}\\) for all \\(k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\).\n\n- \\(\\binom{[4]}{0} = \\{\\emptyset\\}\\) since the only set with 0 elements is \\(\\emptyset\\);\n</markdown>",

Intuitively, by devising a step-by-step procedure for specifying an element of \\( X \\), we are constructing a cartesian product \\(\\prod_{k=1}^{n} X_k\\), where \\( X_k \\) is the set of choices to be made in the \\( k \\)th step. This establishes a bijection \\(\\prod_{k=1}^{n} X_k \\to X\\), which by bijective proof (Strategy 6.1.16(c)) lets us compute \\( |X| \\) as the product of the numbers of choices that can be made in each step.\n\n### Strategy 8.1.13 (Multiplication principle (independent version))\nLet \\( X \\) be a finite set. In order to compute \\( |X| \\), it suffices to find a step-by-step procedure for specifying elements of \\( X \\), such that:\n\n- Each element is specified by a unique sequence of choices;\n- Each step in the procedure is independent of the previous step;\n- There are finitely many choices to be made at each step.\n\nIf there are \\( n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\) steps and \\( m_k \\in \\mathbb{N} \\) possible choices in the \\( k \\)th step, then \\( |X| = \\prod_{k=1}^{n} m_k \\).\n\n### Example 8.1.14\nYou go to an ice cream stand selling the following flavours:\n\nvanilla, strawberry, chocolate, rum and raisin, mint choc chip, toffee crunch\n\nYou can have your ice cream in a tub, a regular cone or a choco-cone.

This is true, since the function \\( X^{(1)} \\to P \\) defined by \\( a \\mapsto (a) \\) is evidently a bijection.\n\n- **(Induction step)** Fix \\( n \\geq 1 \\) and assume that the statement is true for this value of \\( n \\).\n\nLet \\( m_1, m_2, \\ldots, m_n, m_{n+1} \\in \\mathbb{N} \\) and suppose that we are given finite sets \\( X_{a_1, \\ldots, a_{i-1}}^{(i)} \\) for each \\( i \\in [n+1] \\) just as in the statement of the theorem, and let\n\n\\[\nP = \\{ (a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{n+1}) \\mid a_1 \\in X^{(1)}, a_2 \\in X_{a_1}^{(2)}, \\ldots, a_{n+1} \\in X_{a_1, \\ldots, a_n}^{(n+1)} \\}\n\\]\n\nWe need to prove that \\(|P| = m_1 \\times m_2 \\times \\cdots \\times m_n \\times m_{n+1}\\).\n\nSo define\n\n\\[\nQ = \\{ (a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n) \\mid a_1 \\in X^{(1)}, a_2 \\in X_{a_1}^{(2)}, \\ldots, a_n \\in X_{a_1, \\ldots, a_{n-1}}^{(n)} \\}\n\\]\n\nand, given \\( q = (a_1, \\ldots, a_n) \\in Q \\), define \\( Y_q = X_{a_1, \\ldots, a_n}^{(n+1)} \\).

We can specify a bijection \\( f : [3] \\to [3] \\) according to the following procedure.\n\n- **Step 1.** Choose the value of \\( f(1) \\). There are 3 choices.\n\n- **Step 2.** Choose the value of \\( f(2) \\).

The values \\( f(3) \\) can take depend on the values of \\( f(1) \\) and \\( f(2) \\). We could split into the (six!) cases based on the values of \\( f(1) \\) and \\( f(2) \\) chosen in Steps 1 and 2; but we won’t. Instead, note that \\(\\{f(1), f(2)\\}\\) has two elements, and by injectivity \\( f(3) \\) must have a distinct value, so that \\([3] \\setminus \\{f(1), f(2)\\}\\) has one element. This element must be the value of \\( f(3) \\). Hence there is only possible choice of \\( f(3) \\).\n\nBy the multiplication principle, there are \\( 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6 \\) bijections \\([3] \\to [3]\\).\n\n### Exercise 8.1.22\n\nCount the number of injections \\([3] \\to [4]\\).\n\n### Example 8.1.23\n\nWe count the number of ways we can shuffle a standard deck of cards in such a way that the colour of the cards alternate between red and black.\n</markdown>",

That is, all of our partitions will take form \\(\\{U_1, U_2, \\ldots, U_n\\}\\) for some \\( n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\).\n\nWith all of this said, let’s get right to it.\n\n### Theorem 8.1.24 (Addition principle)\nLet \\( X \\) be a set and let \\(\\{U_1, \\ldots, U_n\\}\\) be a partition of \\( X \\) for some \\( n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\), such that each set \\( U_i \\) is finite.

We can (and do) generalise this slightly: it says that given \\( q \\in \\mathbb{N} \\), if you have more than \\( q \\) times as many pigeons than pigeonholes, then some pigeonhole must have more than \\( q \\) pigeons in it.\n\nThe proof is deceptively simple.\n\n#### Theorem 8.1.31 (Pigeonhole principle)\n\nLet \\( q \\in \\mathbb{N} \\), and let \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) be finite sets with \\(|X| = m \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) and \\(|Y| = n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\).

It follows from Exercise 5.2.25 that the sets \\( f^{-1}(\\{a\\}) \\) partition \\( X \\). Towards a contradiction, assume \\(|f^{-1}(\\{a\\})| \\leq q\\) for all \\( a \\in Y \\).
